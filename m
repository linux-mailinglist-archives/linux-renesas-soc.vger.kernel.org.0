After thoroughly reading the A5PSW doc again, I feel that this sentence is not
exactly true. If I refer to section 4.5.3.9, paragraph 3.c:

The VLAN table is used for both, VLAN domain verification [...] as well as VLAN
resolution. Once the frame has passed any VLAN domain verification (i.e. will
not be discarded by the verification function already), the forwarding
resolution applies.
[...]
- If the destination MAC address (Unicast or Multicast) is not found in the MAC
address table, or if the destination address is the Broadcast address, the frame
is forwarded according to the following rules:
  - The destination port mask is loaded from the respective register
U/M/BCAST_DEFAULT_MASK depending on unicast, multicast or broadcast. Then the
following filtering on this mask applies.
    - If the frame carries a VLAN tag, the VLAN resolution table is searched for
a matching VLAN ID and the frame is sent only to ports that are associated with
the VLAN ID.
    - If the frame carries a VLAN tag and the VLAN ID does not match any entry
in the VLAN Resolution Table, or the frame does not carry a VLAN tag, the frame
is forwarded to all ports that are enabled by the default mask.
    - If it cannot be associated with any VLAN group and if the default group
has been set to all zero, the frame is discarded.
[...]

I understand from the second bullet that even when vlan filtering is enabled
(which occurs as first step), the first flooding filter (used in second step,
resolution) remains the flooding masks from unicast/multicast/broadcast default
mask registers. The vlan resolution is then applied over it as a second filter,
and only make the flooding more "restrictive", it does not bypass it (so if a
port is in the vlan which VID is in an incoming packet but the port is not also
defined in the U/M/B default mask, incoming packet won't be flooded to it).
