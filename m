There are already two proposed fixes available, and both Geert and me 
are available for testing any other fixes too.

And yes, this is a regression, because this causes a kernel crash which 
did not happen before.

That does not imply, that the code is not buggy.

Actually, this change landed only very recently and completely broke the 
GX6250 on R-Car M3W, which used to probe and work before. Now the driver 
does not even probe with "Unsupported GPU" output, which is clearly bogus.

I would say the aforementioned commit introduced another new regression 
-- something that used to work before no longer works, functionality was 
lost because of the change.

I don't think it is a good solution to selectively block specific 
hardware, only to avoid triggering the power domain issue. The power 
domain issue should be fixed, not hidden.

Actually no, the hardware support should be as broad as possible, 
without imposing any artificial limitations like that. This allows users 
to test the driver and find errors, which if they are fixed, ultimately 
improve quality of the driver.

I am not saying the code should be removed, I am saying the regression 
should be fixed. There are already two proposed fixes available, so it 
would be good to move them forward.

1c21f240fbc1e ("drm/imagination: Warn or error on unsupported hardware") 
should be reverted, this is not helping anything. Warning message would 
be fine though.

As far as I understand that, Geert was waiting for input from PM people?

At the beginning of this thread, almost a month ago, there was the 
following exchange, hence I was under the impression that a fix is coming:
