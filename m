You aren't doing call_rcu() enough to hit OOM, are you?  The actual RCU
callback invocations won't happen until some time after the scheduler
starts up.

During boot before interrupts are enabled, RCU has not yet spawned any of
its kthreads.  Therefore, all of its attempts to do wakeups would notice
a NULL task_struct pointer and refrain from actually doing the wakeup.
If it did do the wakeup, you would see a NULL-pointer exception.  See
for example, invoke_rcu_core_kthread(), though that won't happen unless
you booted with rcutree.use_softirq=0.

Besides, since when did doing a wakeup enable interrupts?  That would
make it hard to do wakeups from hardware interrupt handlers, not?

But why not put some WARN_ON_ONCE(!irqs_disabled()) calls in the areas
of greatest suspicion, starting from the stack trace generated by that
mutex_lock()?  A stray interrupt-enable could be pretty much anywhere.

But where are those call_rcu() invocations?  Before rcu_init()?
Presumably before init is spawned and the early_init() calls.

And what is the RCU-related Kconfig and boot-parameter setup?
