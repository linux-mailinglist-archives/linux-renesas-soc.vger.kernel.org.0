Well, that didn't seem to work. Perhaps we still have some drivers that
do not handle -EPROBE_DEFER correctly. Will check...

I am not sure where these links are created. In the example above
"ca57-cpu0" is the device name of the supplier, but that is not the name
of a platform device.  Doesn't the core create devlinks between platform
devices? If yes, who creates this link to a non-platform device,
and can that code be updated easily to take into account the index cell?

Makes sense.
