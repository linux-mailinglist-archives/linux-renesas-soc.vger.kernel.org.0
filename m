What is "too fragile" is trying to change this and expecting everything
to continue working as it did before.

How will switching to EFI help?  Won't the crashdump kernel detect EFI
and try to get the memory map from EFI, whereby it runs into exactly
the same issue that the DT approach does?

The current crashkernel situation works precisely because of the 128M
masking that is being done.
