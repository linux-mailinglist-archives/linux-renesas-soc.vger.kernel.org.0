Is that a question ? Anyway, yes, there is a bit of DRAM below the 32bit
boundary and some more above the 32bit boundary. These two banks don't
need to be continuous. And then you could add the SRAM into the mix.

What's the problem with that? The bootloader has all that information
and can patch the DT correctly. In fact, in my specific case, I have
platform which can be populated with differently sized DRAM, so the
holes are also dynamically calculated ; there is no one DT then, the
bootloader is responsible to generate the dma-ranges accordingly.
