You mean it is ok to exceed the speed limit because others do it
as well ?

[ Sorry, I have heard the "Other drivers do it" pseudo-argument too many times.
   That doesn't mean it is the right thing to do. ]

Why not just leave it off ? What value does it add ? Besides,
even "via devicetree" isn't really correct because it can also
be set via ACPI or by a platform driver when using device_ properties.
I would suggest "can be set with device properties".

Just like the ABI must not be changed. The sensors command would display your
4mV shunt voltage as 4V, which is just as useless.

In practice, the shunt voltage _is_ useless for hardware monitoring purpose
because it can be calculated from current and shunt resistor value.
I'd say if you really want it, provide it as debugfs attribute. As hwmon
attribute it has to be in mV.

No, I missed the "+ channel".

Not really. For the shunt voltage, 0xf000 has different meanings depending on scale
and range settings. LSB for bus voltage is 4 mV and starts at bit 2 or 3 depending
on BRNG. The above just happens to be correct if BRNG = 10 OR 11 per datasheet.
If that is intentional, it needs to get a comment.

Parameter checks are only acceptable on API functions. This is not an API function.
Local functions are expected to be consistent. If this function is called with
a bad argument, that needs to be fixed during development.

This is not an old driver. It is more generic than of_ functions and
should be used in new drivers.

Device property callback functions existed for a long time. The function
exists in v4.14.y, which is the oldest supported kernel. Either case,
lack of support in an older kernel version is not an argument for avoiding
a new API. Anyone who backports a driver to an older kernel is responsible
for handling the backport, which may include new API functions.

Specific example: Your driver will have to use the .probe callback.
That has one argument in the latest kernel. In v5.15.y, it has two arguments.
You'll have to use the .probe_new callback there. Yes, technically you could
try sneaking in the use of .probe_new in your driver, but that callback will
be removed in v6.6. So you'll _have_ to do some backport, if you want it or not.

It is needed for device_property_read_u32() to work. And, again, "other drivers
do it" is not a valid argument.
