Yes. So far every write size I tried is slow.
Sometimes (1 out of 50) small writes are fast, that's most likely a caching effect
of eMMC internals.

Wouldn't that explain only the first slow write?
I see poor write speed also on repeated runs.

The eMMC manufacturer says there is nothing special about the boot area
and write speed should be equally fast.

Can it be that rcar-gen3-sdhi changes some timings after switching?
Either in software or on hardware.
