Right, good point!

Okay, good!

That needs some more thinking, but potentially it could work - at
least for this particular case with clk_set_rate().

Although, as it's likely that the subsystem/driver is already handling
the clock(s), the whole thing with using GENPD_FLAG_PM_CLK is in most
cases superfluous. That means we end up running unnecessary code-paths
during runtime suspend/resume (to ungate/gate clock(s) twice) - and
that involves acquiring/releasing locks too, when that isn't really
needed.

Kind regards
Uffe
