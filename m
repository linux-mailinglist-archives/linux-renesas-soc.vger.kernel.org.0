Call "setpci -s $bdf_root_port BRIDGE_CONTROL" with address of the PCIe
Root Port device (parent of selected device). This will print value of
bridge control register. Logical OR it with value 0x20 (Secondary Bus
Reset Bit) and call "setpci -s $bdf_root_port BRIDGE_CONTROL=$new_value".
After this call is link in the Hot Reset state and you can do any test.
To bring link back, call setpci again with cleared 0x20 bit mask.

Similar test you can done also with setting Link Disable bit (bit 4) in
PCIe Link Control register. Offset to this register is not static and
you can figure it out from lspci -s $bdf_root_port -vv output.
Retrain Link is bit 5 in the same register.
