If you've got devices making random unsolicited accesses then who's to 
say they wouldn't also hit valid windows and corrupt memory? If it's 
happening at all you've already lost. And realistically, if the address 
isn't valid then it's not going to make much difference anyway - in 
probably 99% of cases, either the transaction doesn't hit a window and 
the host bridge returns a completer abort, or it does hit a window, the 
AXI side returns DECERR or SLVERR, and the host bridge translates that 
into a completer abort. Consider also that many PCI IPs don't have 
discrete windows and just map the entirety of PCI mem space directly to 
the system PA space.

I don't believe this is a valid argument for anything whichever way round.

Robin.
