Are you still running into any problems on your hardware with these 
patches applied ?

That is exactly what this patch fixes, the ISB enforces the async 
exception at the right moment so it can be fixed up in the fixup handler 
(thanks Arnd).

No, last time I tried tweaking the mapping, that didn't lead to sync aborts.

I am positive LDR triggers async abort on this hardware, since that's 
how this problem was triggered by Geert.
