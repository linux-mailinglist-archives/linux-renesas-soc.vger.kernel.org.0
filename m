I wrote this to Niklas already, so let me expand on it:

My understanding of reset GPIO in the MDIO node is that it is used in 
case there might be multiple PHYs with shared reset GPIO on the same 
MDIO bus. Like on the NXP iMX28 .

In this case, the reset is connected to this single PHY, so the reset 
line connection is a property of the PHY and should be described in the 
PHY node.

You could argue that in this case, because there is only one PHY and 
only one reset line, it fits both categories, PHY reset and MDIO reset.

And then, there is the future-proofing aspect.

If the compatible string is retained, then if in the future there is 
some problem discovered related to the reset of this PHY, the PHY driver 
can match on the compatible string and apply a fix up. But it prevents 
future PHY replacement (which is unlikely in my opinion).

If the compatible string is removed and the reset is moved to MDIO node, 
then replacement of the PHY in the future is likely possible (assuming 
it does not have any special reset timing requirements), but if there is 
a problem related to the reset of the current PHY model, the PHY driver 
cannot fix it up because there is no compatible to match on.

I think that about sums the pros and cons up, right ?

I also think there is no good solution here, only two bad ones, with 
different issues each.

I had that happen too. The solution there was to upstream the newer PHY 
ID and apply backward compatibility DTO that rewrote the PHY ID for the 
few older boards. The DTO application decision was done in U-Boot scripting.

It was not possible to auto-detect the PHY after deasserting its reset 
in my case, I had to determine whether to apply DTO or not based on 
strap resistors on the board.
