I personally like your patch way better than mine, but it will need both
eyes and time on it.  I wouldn't put it past someone to assume that the
boot CPU is running the idle thread early in boot.  :-/

Not from what I can see, but I could be missing something.

Christophe argues that the interrupt stacks must be allocated early
on, and that this acquires a mutex.

Two points in its favor!  ;-)
