I'm with Jonathan here, the devres stuff is getting crazy here and you
have drivers mixing them and side affects happening and lots of
confusion.  Your change here is only going to make it even more
confusing, and shouldn't actually solve it for other busses (i.e. what
about iio devices NOT on the platform bus?)

Why can't your individual driver handle this instead?

thanks,
