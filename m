I discussed this problem last week at a conference and the consensus was 
that this problem of timeouts and the like should in the first hand be 
handled in user-space. The reason being that there might be use-cases 
that are better dealt with there.

If the monitor thread is is strictly needed for some reason in kernel 
thread it should likely be moved to the V4L2 core as all drivers would 
then be able to use it instead of deeding on slightly different 
implementations in each driver.

So I fear we are back to only try to signal xfer errors in the driver 
and then leave it to either user-space or some new V4L2 code to help 
monitoring.

Sorry for only understanding this so late in the review, it took some 
time for me to understand it but once explained to me it made sens.
