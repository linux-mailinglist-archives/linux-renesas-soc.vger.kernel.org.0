In the context of DT describing the platform that doesn't make any 
sense. It's like saying it's fine for U-Boot to also describe a bunch of 
non-existent CPUs just because future SoCs might have them. Just because 
the system would probably still boot doesn't mean it's right.

The crucial thing is that once we improve the existing "dma-ranges" 
handling in the DMA layer such that it *does* consider multiple entries 
properly, platforms presenting ranges which don't actually exist will 
almost certainly start going wrong, and are either going to have to fix 
their broken bootloaders or try to make a case for platform-specific 
workarounds in core code.
