   Iff we can come up with a robust check whether the device is powered on,
we can overcome even the IRQF_SHARED issue though...
   I'm seeing pm_runtime_active() API and wondering whether we can use it
from the IRQ context. Alternatively, we can add a is_opened flag, like
sh_eth.c does...

   OTOH, we'll get a simpler/cleaner code if we do this...
   Previously, I was under an impression that it's common behavior of
the networking drivers to call request_irq() from their ndo_open() methods.
Apparently, it's not true anymore (probably with the introduction of the
managed device API) -- the newer drivers often call devm_request_irq()
from their probe() methods instead...

   This still seems an issue though... My prior experience with the R-Car
MMC driver tells me that U-Boot may leave interrupts enabled... :-/

   Now I've changed my mind -- let's retain your patch! It needs some work
though...
