Subject: [PATCH v7 0/8] Add support for PCIe controller to work in endpoint mode on R-Car/RZ/G2x SoCs

Hi All,

This patch series adds support for PCIe controller on R-Car/RZ-G2x to work in
endpoint mode, this also extends the epf framework to handle base region
for mapping PCI address locally.

Note:
The cadence/rockchip/designware endpoint drivers are build tested only.

Changes for v7 (Respun this version quickly to ML as the changes requested
were quite small and it has been reviewed substantially):
* Fixed review comments pointed by Shimoda-san
  1] Made DT bindings dual licensed, added Shimoda-san as maintainer and fixed
     the example as its built with #{address,size}-cells = <1>. I have still
     restored the Ack from Rob and Shimoda-san with these changes.
  2] Split up the patches so that they can be picked up by respective subsystem
     patches 1/4-9/11 are now part of this series.
  3] Dropped altering a comment in pci-epc.h
  4] Used a local variable align_size in pci_epc_mem_alloc_addr() so that size
     variable doesn't get overwritten in the loop.
  5] Replaced i-=1 with i--
  6] Replaced rcar with R-Car in patch subject and description.
  7] Set MACCTLR in init() callback

Changes for v6:
1] Rebased patches on endpoint branch of https://git.kernel.org/pub/
   scm/linux/kernel/git/lpieralisi/pci.git/
2] Fixed review comments from Shimoda-san
   a] Made sure defconfig changes were in separate patch
   b] Created rcar_pcie_host/rcar_pcie_ep structures
   c] Added pci-id for R8A774C0
   d] Added entry in MAINTAINERS for dt-binding
   e] Dropped unnecessary braces
3] Added support for msi.

Changes for v5:
1] Rebased patches on next branch of https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/
   linux/kernel/git/helgaas/pci.git
2] Fixed review comments reported by Kishon while fetching the matching
   window in function pci_epc_get_matching_window()
3] Fixed review comments reported by Bjorn
   a] Split patch up first patch so that its easier to review and incremental
   b] Fixed typos
4] Included Reviewed tag from Rob for the dt-binding patch
5] Fixed issue reported by Nathan for assigning variable to itself

Changes for v4:
1] Fixed dtb_check error reported by Rob
2] Fixed review comments reported by Kishon
   a] Dropped pci_epc_find_best_fit_window()
   b] Fixed initializing mem ptr in __pci_epc_mem_init()
   c] Dropped map_size from pci_epc_mem_window structure

Changes for v3:
1] Fixed review comments from Bjorn and Kishon.
3] Converted to DT schema

Changes for v2:
1] Fixed review comments from Biju for dt-bindings to include an example
   for a tested platform.
2] Fixed review comments from Kishon to extend the features of outbound
   regions in epf framework.
3] Added support to parse outbound-ranges in OF.
