Indeed, and I was about to look into it.

There are multiple ways to skin this cat, including renaming
'interrupt-map' to 'my-own-private-interrupt-map'. Or use something
akin the new 'msi-range' (which we could call interrupt-range), and
replace:

  interrupt-map = <0 0 &gic GIC_SPI 4 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
                  <1 0 &gic GIC_SPI 5 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
                  <2 0 &gic GIC_SPI 6 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
                  <3 0 &gic GIC_SPI 7 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
                  <4 0 &gic GIC_SPI 8 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
                  <5 0 &gic GIC_SPI 9 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
                  <6 0 &gic GIC_SPI 10 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
                  <7 0 &gic GIC_SPI 11 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;

with:

  interrupt-range = <&gic GIC_SPI 4 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH 0 8>;

which reads as "base interrupt spec", "start pin", "count".  This
gives you almost the same level of information, and doesn't interfere
with the rest of the DT properties. Parsing it is also much simpler.
But that's up to you, really.
