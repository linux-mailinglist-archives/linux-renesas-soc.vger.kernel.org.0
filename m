You are right, in plus mode, we can't receive any interrupt between
claim & complete, then the irq could be lost.

I think the design follows the sentence written by PLIC spec:
https://github.com/riscv/riscv-plic-spec/blob/master/riscv-plic.adoc

If the global interrupt source was edge-triggered, the gateway will
convert the =EF=AC=81rst matching signal edge into an interrupt request.
Depending on the design of the device and the interrupt handler, in
between sending an interrupt request and receiving notice of its
handler=E2=80=99s completion, the gateway might either **ignore additional
matching edges** or increment a counter of pending interrupts.

Also, the hardware could easily support the feature, but the engineer
follows the first choice and disable the useful function. -_*!
