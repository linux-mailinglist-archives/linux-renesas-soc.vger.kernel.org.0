I don't disagree. That's one of the reason I wanted to gather requirement
few years back when PSCI system suspend was introduced. I couldn't
convince PSCI spec authors myself.

I understand and I agree. That's the main reason I want to understand this
better and provide a generic solution. The current pm_suspend_via_firmware
seem to have different intentions(at-least that's what I grasped quickly
reading through the document)

Yes, I wanted something similar initially but didn't get good response
both from community and PSCI spec authors.

I can't disagree with that. The description of the issue and the solution
in the thread is. We need make it more generic and provide generic solution,.
I already see 2-3 threads addressing this in isolation as specific issue.
Also we need to check with DT maintainers if there are fine with the idea
of binding to address this issue.
