Thanks!

I gave it a try on a system with an 800 MHz Cortex A9, only to discover
it makes no difference, as that machine has 1600 BogoMIPS:

workqueue: drm_fb_helper_damage_work hogged CPU for >10000us 4 times,
consider switching to WQ_UNBOUND
workqueue: drm_fb_helper_damage_work hogged CPU for >10000us 8 times,
consider switching to WQ_UNBOUND
workqueue: genpd_power_off_work_fn hogged CPU for >10000us 4 times,
consider switching to WQ_UNBOUND
workqueue: blk_mq_run_work_fn hogged CPU for >10000us 4 times,
consider switching to WQ_UNBOUND
workqueue: pm_runtime_work hogged CPU for >10000us 4 times, consider
switching to WQ_UNBOUND
workqueue: phy_state_machine hogged CPU for >10000us 4 times, consider
switching to WQ_UNBOUND
workqueue: drm_mode_rmfb_work_fn hogged CPU for >10000us 4 times,
consider switching to WQ_UNBOUND
workqueue: sync_hw_clock hogged CPU for >10000us 4 times, consider
switching to WQ_UNBOUND
workqueue: rtc_timer_do_work hogged CPU for >10000us 4 times, consider
switching to WQ_UNBOUND

Artificially low BogoMIPS numbers only happen on systems that have
the related timers (Cortex A7/A15 and later, Cortex A9 MPCore,
and arm64).

I will test on more systems, but that will probably not happen until
next week...
