So with this patch, we finish the transition to L1 and immediately
return to L0.  That must mean that even in this in-between state we
save some power?

And the link may stay in that in-between state indefinitely, until the
CPU does an MMIO access or the device initiates a DMA?  But it will
never spend any time in L1 because the link never actually *gets* to
L1 until some event that will take it back to L0 occurs?

Thanks for that; please include it in the commit log for the next
version.
