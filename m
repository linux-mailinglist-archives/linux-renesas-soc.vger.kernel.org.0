I'm afraid I misinterpreted your request. I've pushed your proposal to
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-renesas-soc/20201030083051.18752-4-erosca@de.adit-jv.com/

I personally no longer use KF M03, since its major limitation is not
being able to update the contents of Hyperflash using Lauterbach if
ULCB is stacked on the expansion board (unplugging ULCB each time
it is flashed is absolutely not practical).

I've heard from audio engineers that recent revisions are more suitable
for audio use-cases, but I don't know the full details.

I will try to collect more information and, if I succeed, I will come
back with feedback. Thank you for your patience.
