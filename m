Correct. You can try to derived that in a way you did and put below.
Although, Dhrystone is a synthetic micro-benchmark with small
impact to data caches, so it will not use much power.

Right. From those power values can be try to derive the
'CPU only power' values - assuming only one core was
running the test.

AFAIU you don't have proper DVFS due to missing voltage scaling.

Therefore...
Out of that I got these CPU power values:
800MHz -> 174mW
1000MHz -> 212mW
1200MHz -> 261mW

Those power values listed above look a bit higher, but they
could be more related to a benchmark which utilized caches
and more parts of the CPU. I don't know if you had chance to
see some of my presentations on Linux conferences, where
I show how much power can vary in different scenarios at
the same frequency...
TLDR; it can be even 1.8x comparing to Dhrystone.

So would say it's OK for you to put either your Dhrystone
power results, or these one from EM dump (probably from
some more heavy benchmark then set into DT coefficient
to derive them in OPP fwk).

Your platform AFAIK is not Heterogeneous, so it won't be used
in EAS w/ that EM. It will be only used for thermal governor
IPA or PowerCap DTPM, which require EM to work.
