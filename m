So the idea is to disable unused genpds and clocks from the genpd
resp. clock's driver .sync_state() callback, instead of from a late
initcall?  That would indeed solve issues related to "Case A".

However, how to solve "Case B"? Ignore disabling genpds or clocks
before .sync_state() callback() has been called?
That would cause issues for cases where the clock must be disabled,
cfr.

Tomi: Do you have more details? The genpd must be controlling something
critical that must never be turned off, or perhaps the display driver
lacks some initialization?

Thanks!
