   If RPM calls work in the probe()/remove() methods, they should work
in the ndo_{open|stop}() methods, right?

   That's a usual problem with the kernel development...

   That's why we have the long bug fixing period after -rc1...

   Have you seen the following commit (that I've already posted for you on
IRC)?

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=7fa2955ff70ce4532f144d26b8a087095f9c9ffc

   Looks like the RPM calls won't do here...

   That's what your current PD driver does... isn't it possible that
in some new SoCs the PD would be completely powered off?

   Looking at __dev_set_rx_mode(), the method gets only called when
(dev->flags & IFF_UP) is true -- but that contradicts your experience,
it seems... However, looking at net/core/dev_addr_lists.c, that function
is called from the atomic contexts, so please just return early.

   Yes, it's not the code, no need to go beyond 80 cols, I think...
