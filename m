something similar like below ?

       pcie_ep: pcie_ep@fe000000 {
               compatible = "renesas,pcie-r8a7791", "renesas,pcie-rcar-gen2";
               reg = <0 0xfe000000 0 0x80000>;
               reg-names = "apb-base";
               clocks = <&cpg CPG_MOD 319>;
               clock-names = "pcie";
               power-domains = <&sysc R8A774C0_PD_ALWAYS_ON>;
               resets = <&cpg 319>;
               mem-region {
                       base =  <0x0 0xfe100000 0 0x100000>,
                                    <0x0 0xfe200000 0 0x200000>,
