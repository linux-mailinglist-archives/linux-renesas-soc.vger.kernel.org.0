D is passive DP->HDMI, it won't work. Are you saying it works, and the 
result matches the test case 1.?

"same results" means same as in 1.?

Where did you read that? I don't think there's such a thing as "eDP 
cable". In laptops etc. eDP is connected to the panel via custom made 
cables, and the cable design affects how long it can be. eDP and DP are 
identical wrt. signaling, so using a DP cable with eDP or DP should 
behave the same.

That said, I don't think the eDP->DP connector designs we see in these 
development boards are really made to match what one would expect from a 
consumer device with a DP output.

My guess is that this works, because there's an active component there 
which decodes the DP input and re-encodes it to HDMI output, probably 
with different timings (read, more standard). So the (C) is more 
tolerant on not-so-standard DP input than (A) is.

The eDP chip is limited in its capabilities, e.g. back porch registers 
are 8-bit, so they max out at 255. While those are checked in the 
driver, I wouldn't be surprised if some other limitations are not (the 
driver has clearly been written for eDP panels).

You could try different custom timings with kmstest, to find if there's 
something obvious that makes the case 1. work. For example, if the issue 
is indeed the cable, probably lowering the pixel clock would fix it. So 
using the same timings but dropping the pclk in half might get a stable 
picture (then again, lowering pclk might fix many other kinds of issues 
too...).

Can you send your monitor's edid blob? I don't have a board up here, but 
it should be available from somewhere in sysfs. On my desktop it's:

/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:02.0/drm/card1/card1-DP-2/edid
