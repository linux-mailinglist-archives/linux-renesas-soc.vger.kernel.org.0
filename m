Hello this is refersh of our GMSL work.

Current situation is the following:
- Kieran sent a full v4 with multiplexed stream support and has a v5 branch in
  his repository with v4 review comment fixes on top

	I rebased the multiplexed stream's series on latest media-master
	https://jmondi.org/cgit/linux/log/?h=v4l2-mux/media-master/v6

	On top of that I took Kieran's v5 and re-applied on top:
	https://jmondi.org/cgit/linux/log/?h=jmondi/gmsl/kieran/v6

- Niklas sent a v1 (which sould have been a v5) which removes multiplexed
  streams and only support one camera and was meant for inclusion but is still
  floating around in linux-media, mostly because some of the comments on
  Kieran's v4 still applied there, if I'm not mistaken.

	I took Niklas' single stream max9286 and replaced the original
	bindings with a json-schema version
	https://jmondi.org/cgit/linux/log/?h=jmondi/gmsl/niklas/v6

I bumped all versions to v6 to avoid further confusion.

Not having a working GMSL setup I would ask to Kieran or Niklas to test this
version so that we can try re-send the single stream max9286 version with new
yaml bindings for inclusion.

(I kept linux-media e devicetree out as I would like to test the patches before
expanding the receivers list)

Thanks
   j
