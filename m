If I understand Yoshihiro's patch, it pulls code out into
dw_pcie_link_set_max_link_width() without changing that code.  That
seems like the best approach to me because it's very easy to review.

If we want to remove a little redundant code later in a separate
patch, that's fine too but doesn't seem urgent.  I don't think they
need to be tied together.
