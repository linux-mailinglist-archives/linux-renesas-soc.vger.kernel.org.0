If the HW (given that those dma-ranges are declared for the PCI host
controller) can't be programmed to enable those DMA ranges - those
ranges are neither available nor usable, ergo DT is broken.

dma-ranges is a property that is used by other kernel subsystems eg
IOMMU other than the RCAR host controller driver. The policy, provided
there is one should be shared across them. You can't leave a PCI
host controller half-programmed and expect other subsystems (that
*expect* those ranges to be DMA'ble) to work.

I reiterate my point: if firmware is broken it is better to fail
the probe rather than limp on hoping that things will keep on
working.
