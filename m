I understand that Linux programs the endpoints correctly. However this
still doesn't prevent the endpoint from being broken and from sending a
transaction to that non-existent memory. The PCI controller can prevent
that and in an automotive SoC, I would very much like the PCI controller
to do just that, rather than hope that the endpoint would always work.
