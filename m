True, my cases were specific boards we are (or will) support in Zephyr OS.

I didn't though about what would happen on other boards with the same 
SoC while testing, my bad.

When working on this I understood that critical clocks were not only 
preserved but were also managed differently at boot.
My point was only to preserve these form gating so I though that marking 
them as critical was a bit overkill.
My understanding of the difference between critical and unused clocks is 
maybe not the good one !

I started working on this for an S4 based board as we are not yet 
supporting multiple domain control on our Zephyr support.

Concerning Gen3 SoCs, you are right, we are already using RMSTPCRn 
module on our H3 SoC implementation so this part of my patch is useless 
anyway !

I'll keep this patch on my side while working on multiple domains 
support on our Gen4 Zephyr support.

Thanks again for your answer.
