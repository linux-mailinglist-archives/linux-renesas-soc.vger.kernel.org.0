If you really want to sacrifice DMA efficiency for a perceived increase 
in theoretical robustness by setting very conservative windows, then 
ultimately it's your choice, go ahead. It's just that you *need* to make 
that choice in the bootloader, not in Linux. If Linux gets passed 
dma-ranges that aren't actually reflected by the hardware, such that 
this patch is needed, then it *will* go wrong eventually, and you'll 
only get an "I told you so" from me.

The bootloader knows what platform it's running on, so it has no excuse 
for emitting more ranges than there are available windows on that platform.
