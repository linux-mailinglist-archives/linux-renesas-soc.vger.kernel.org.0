I'll try to explain it better.

The power domain implementation in this series tries to abstract the
control of bus clock (though MSTOP registers) for individual modules
available in RZ/G3S SoC.

From hardware manual [1]: "The Module Standby Mode is a mode that requests
the clock stop of the module specified by the master. The purpose of this
mode is to reduce power consumption by stopping unnecessary functions."

MSTOP is connected to individual modules as described in this picture:
https://paste.pics/726c963c33a506651a4be5f327e2a46d

There is also the PWRDN functionality for the modules that are part of the
PD_ISOVCC domain. At the time of writing this series there was not much
information in hardware manual about PWRDN functionality. The design team
has been asked but there is no clear answer ATM if the sequence of using
PWRDN in Linux (as proposed in this series) is good or not. I encountered
no issues with it while experimenting thus I have kept it. If you prefer I
can drop it and return with something afterwards, if any.

As I said in the current implementation I also used the PWRDN. The PWRDN is
IP specific but takes effect (as of my experiments) when this is executed:

+       /* Prepare for power down the BUSes in power down mode. */
+       if (info->pm_domain_pwrdn_mstop)
+               writel(CPG_PWRDN_MSTOP_ENABLE, priv->base + CPG_PWRDN_MSTOP);

As of my experiments having CPG_PWRDN_MSTOP.CPG_PWRDN_MSTOP_ENABLE set
applies the PWRDN to all the IPs for which PWRDN bit has been set in
CPG_PWRDN_IP1 and CPG_PWRD_IP2 registers.

This settings are applied in probe after domains are powered (thus PWRDN
bits are properly set up for IP supporting it by calling ->power_on()) and
at the end of resume (after PWRDN bits are properly setup for IPs
supporting it by calling ->power_on())

From my experiments, when returning from suspend (thus after firmware has
been executed) the CPG_PWRDN_MSTOP_ENABLE bit at register CPG_PWRDN_MSTOP
is zero. We power on the domains in Linux after resuming because of PWRDN
functionality and CPG_PWRDN_MSTOP_ENABLE bit at register CPG_PWRDN_MSTOP.

Yes, Linux has the ability of controlling them by setting MSTOP and PWRDN
bits. This is because the IP specific PWRDN functionality takes effect when
CPG_PWRDN_MSTOP_ENABLE bit at register CPG_PWRDN_MSTOP is set (as of my
experiments).

All this is becuase PWRD functionality. Explaining it to you made me
consider that it would be better to just drop the PWRDN functionality at
the moment until it is fully understood. With it I think we should be able
to drop the rzg2l_cpg_power_on() in resume(), at least. What do you think?

I need to check it.

Thank you for you review,
