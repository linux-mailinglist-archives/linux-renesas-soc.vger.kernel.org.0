Hello,

This series enables support for the R-Car V3U r8a779a0 thermal IP. It 
needs to touch both the device tree schema and driver as the IP is a tad 
different then its siblings in the Gen3 family.

  - It have 4 TSC cells instead of 2-3 that is used in other SoCs.

  - The interrupts are no longer wired to the INTC-AP so the driver 
    can't make use of them directly and are therefor made optional for 
    the V3U bindings. For this reason this series depends on [1].

The driver is tested together with it's dependency [1] and [2] on V3U 
and all 4 thermal sensors behaves as expected. The driver has also been 
tested on other R-Car Gen3 SoC for regressions, none where found.

The additional THCODE tuning parameters used in 3/3 are taken from the 
datasheet example and may need to be updated. In future the tuning 
parameters shall be read from fused registers on the IP directly and the 
hardcoded values in the driver only used as fallback for IP where the 
values are not fused.

1. [PATCH] thermal: rcar_gen3_thermal: Do not use interrupts for normal operation
2. [PATCH 0/2] clk: renesas: r8a779a0: Add clocks to support thermal
