Nothing missing from my point of view, so if Lorenzo is OK with it,
he'll apply it.  If I were applying it, I would make the commit log
something like this:

  When the link is in L1, hardware should return it to L0
  automatically whenever a transaction targets a component on the
  other end of the link (PCIe r5.0, sec 5.2).

  The R-Car PCIe controller doesn't handle this transition correctly.
  If the link is not in L0, an MMIO transaction targeting a downstream
  device fails, and the controller reports an ARM imprecise external
  abort.

  Work around this by hooking the abort handler so the driver can
  detect this situation and help the hardware complete the link state
  transition.

  When the R-Car controller receives a PM_ENTER_L1 DLLP from the
  downstream component, it sets PMEL1RX bit in PMSR register, but then
  the controller enters some sort of in-between state.  A subsequent
  MMIO transaction will fail, resulting in the external abort.  The
  abort handler detects this condition and completes the link state
  transition by setting the L1IATN bit in PMCTLR and waiting for the
  link state transition to complete.

I assume that on the PCIe side, there must be an error like
Unsupported Request or Malformed TLP, and the R-Car controller is
logging that and turning it into the ARM external abort?

I didn't see a clear response to Pali's question about what happens if
there's no MMIO access, e.g., what if the downstream device initiates
a DMA or MSI transaction?
