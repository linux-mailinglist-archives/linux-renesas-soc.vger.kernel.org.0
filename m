Though I agree in most of the case, I am not sure in this particular
case as they may not need any downstream kernel changes for SCMI. All
they need is DT nodes.

Since I see absolute silence from Renesas, I am happy to revert if no
one has any objections.

Correct, I would rather make it generic based on clock flags like in this
case it is CLK_SET_PARENT_GATE or CLK_SET_RATE_GATE or something right ?
