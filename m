Then you have no problem because you don't hit this fault.

Yes, for the aarch64 rcar the same fix is implemented in atf (see below).

This seems to be exactly the situation the commit message describes -- 
the controller is stuck between L states and needs manual register write 
to proceed.

There doesn't seem to be much ongoing HW development on the arm32 r-car, 
so I don't expect this list of hooks to grow much on this platform.
