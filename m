If this is the case, at first I would have tempted to say why not use the SCMI
Quirk framework (with needed changes/evolutions), BUT then I realized that being
the Quirk to be applied on the transport there is no way to gather SCMI
Vendor info and versions from the platform, so you would have to match on the
compatible, which is essentially similar approach of having a new DT
prop...just less flexible so I understand the need of your new-prop approach...

...BUT...(maybe a weird idea)...what if we think about enabling:

 - one Quirk EARLY-ON based on the current potentially affected compatibles
   with such a quirk forcing polling ONLY for the BASE Protocol SCMI queries
   so that the SCMI core can gather Vendor Info and versions in any case..
   (this would need the Quirk frmwk to be evolved to support such
    'early-quirks' based on compatibles only)

 - a second regular Quirk, filtered by the just retrieved Vendor INFO and FW
   version to finally decide if the system needs force-polling to be really
   enabled for all the following messages...

... this was you dint even need to ship any new DT

So the deployment scenario would be to update new machines with a fully
working SCP FW with completion-IRQ while updating ONLY the DTBs with the
new force-polling property in the older machines with the older
poll-only SCP fw ? (to understand)

Thanks,
Cristian
