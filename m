We have a similar situation with SPI, where a controller can operate in
master or slave mode, based on the absence or presence of the
"spi-slave" DT property.

You can still have two separate drivers, binding against the same
compatible value.  Just let the .probe() function return -ENODEV if it
discovers (by looking at DT properties) if the node is configured for
the other mode.
Which brings us to my next questions: is there any code that could be
shared between the drivers for the two modes?

Having two separate DT binding documents sounds fine to me, if unifying
them makes things too complex.
However, I think they should use the same compatible value, because the
hardware block is the same, but just used in a different mode.

Rob/Mark: Any input from the DT maintainers?

Are they fixed by the PCIe hardware, i.e. could they be looked up by the
driver based on the compatible value?
