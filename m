I don't think it's different in that aspect. Except the bus has this
32bit limitation, where it only sees subset of the DRAM.

Why should the DMA ranges incorrectly cover also the DRAM which is not
present ?

But then the PCI device can trigger a transaction to non-existent DRAM
and cause undefined behavior. Surely we do not want that ?

But the OS can assume the ranges are correct and cover only valid
memory, right ? That is, memory into which the PCI controller can safely
access.
