While I understand the sentiments here, PSCI is targeted to address CPU
power state management mainly and system states like suspend/reset and
poweroff which involves last CPU. This is one of the reason it is out of
the scope of the specification.

Here is my understanding. DT specifies all the wakeup sources. Linux
can configure those and user may choose to enable a subset of them is
wakeup. As stated in the spec and also based on what we already do in
the kernel, we disable all other wakeup sources.

The PSCI firmware can then either read those from the interrupt controller
or based on static platform understanding, must not disable those wakeup
sources.

It is easy for DT to get out of sync with firmware unless it is generated
by the same firmware. That's the reason why I am against such multiple
sources of information. I understand ACPI has more flexibility and I did
discuss this in LPC few years back and people were happy to have simple
model as I have mentioned above. I was pushing to add more clarity to
the specification but as I mentioned it was rejected as it is more a cpu
and system centric spec and avoids talking about devices which I kind
of agree.

Each device or platform having its specific property in DT is not scalable.
Not sure if it is a generic problem. If it is, I would like to understand
more details on such lack of ability for communtication between OS and
firmware.
