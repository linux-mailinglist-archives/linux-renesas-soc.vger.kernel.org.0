The PHY reset block is an individual hardware block with its own address
space, clocks and reset signals.

The PHY block may reside in the same address space with USB controller but
it can provide PHY support for an external USB controller, something like:

+--------------------------+
|  PHY ---> USB controller |
|   |                      |
+---|----------------------+
   \/
+---------------+
| USB controller|
+---------------+

Because of this the PHY block is modeled in Linux as a standalone driver.

And SYSC is an individual HW block with its own address space. This is
where it resides the control of the signal for which I'm asking for directions.

With my understanding of it, that should not happen, at least not with the
current implementation of the drivers involved in this.

I would prefer this option, too.

This option is what I've explored, tested on my side.

I explored it in 2 ways:

1/ SYSC modeled as an individual PM domain provider (this is more
   appropriate to how HW manual described the hardware) with this the PHY
   reset DT node would have to get 2 PM domains handlers (one for the
   current PM domain provider and the other one for SYSC):

+               phyrst: usbphy-ctrl@11e00000 {
+                       compatible = "renesas,r9a08g045-usbphy-ctrl";
+                       reg = <0 0x11e00000 0 0x10000>;
+                       clocks = <&cpg CPG_MOD R9A08G045_USB_PCLK>;
+                       resets = <&cpg R9A08G045_USB_PRESETN>;
+                       power-domain-names = "cpg", "sysc";
+                       power-domains = <&cpg R9A08G045_PD_USB_PHY>, <&sysc
R9A08G045_SYSC_PD_USB>;
+                       #reset-cells = <1>;
+                       status = "disabled";
+
+                       usb0_vbus_otg: regulator-vbus {
+                               regulator-name = "vbus";
+                       };
+               };
+

and the PHY reset driver will get bulky with powering on/off both of these,
at least with my current implementation, something like (and the following
code is in probe()):

+       if (priv->set_power) {
+               priv->cpg_genpd_dev = dev_pm_domain_attach_by_name(dev, "cpg");
+               if (IS_ERR(priv->cpg_genpd_dev)) {
+                       dev_err_probe(dev, error, "Failed to attach CPG PM
domain!");
+                       error = PTR_ERR(priv->cpg_genpd_dev);
+                       goto err_pm_runtime_put;
+               }
+
+               priv->sysc_genpd_dev = dev_pm_domain_attach_by_name(dev,
"sysc");
+               if (IS_ERR(priv->sysc_genpd_dev)) {
+                       dev_err_probe(dev, error, "Failed to attach sysc PM
domain!");
+                       error = PTR_ERR(priv->sysc_genpd_dev);
+                       goto err_genpd_cpg_detach;
+               }
+
+               priv->cpg_genpd_dl = device_link_add(dev, priv->cpg_genpd_dev,
+                                                    DL_FLAG_PM_RUNTIME |
+                                                    DL_FLAG_STATELESS);
+               if (!priv->cpg_genpd_dl) {
+                       dev_err_probe(dev, -ENOMEM, "Failed to add CPG
genpd device link!");
+                       goto err_genpd_sysc_detach;
+               }
+
+               priv->sysc_genpd_dl = device_link_add(dev,
priv->sysc_genpd_dev,
+                                                     DL_FLAG_PM_RUNTIME |
+                                                     DL_FLAG_STATELESS);
+               if (!priv->sysc_genpd_dl) {
+                       dev_err_probe(dev, -ENOMEM, "Failed to add sysc
genpd device link!");
+                       goto err_genpd_cpg_dl_del;
+               }
+
+
+               error = pm_runtime_resume_and_get(priv->cpg_genpd_dev);
+               if (error) {
+                       dev_err_probe(dev, error, "Failed to runtime resume
cpg PM domain!");
+                       goto err_genpd_sysc_dl_del;
+               }
+
+               error = pm_runtime_resume_and_get(priv->sysc_genpd_dev);
+               if (error) {
+                       dev_err_probe(dev, error, "Failed to runtime resume
sysc PM domain!");
+                       goto err_genpd_cpg_off;
+               }
+       }
+

2/ SYSC being a PM domain provider parent of the CPG (current PM domain
   provider). With this the phy reset node is like proposed in this series
   (powered by CPG PM domain):

+               phyrst: usbphy-ctrl@11e00000 {
+                       compatible = "renesas,r9a08g045-usbphy-ctrl",
+                                    "renesas,rzg2l-usbphy-ctrl";
+                       reg = <0 0x11e00000 0 0x10000>;
+                       clocks = <&cpg CPG_MOD R9A08G045_USB_PCLK>;

+               };

And the USB SYSC PM domain is parent for all USB PM domains provided by CPG
(3 in this case). With this there should be some glue code b/w CPG (code in
drivers/clk/renesas/{rzg2l-cpg.c, r9a08g045-cpg.c}) and SYSC drivers (I
have something ugly locally, haven't tried to detach CPG code from SYSC
code at the moment).
