I don't know the exact HW level details. It may be a HW bug or possibly 
a firmware issue. But what I see is simple:

If the display subsystem is powered and a video output is enabled, 
turning off the PD causes the display subsystem to go to a bad state, 
after which the next register access will halt the cpu.

This happens quite easily if the bootloader has enabled a display: when 
the kernel's tidss driver probes, the device framework will make sure 
the PD is enabled (which is fine, it's basically a no-op). But if the 
tidss returns an error, like EPROBE_DEFER, the device framework will 
disable the PD. When the tidss driver probes again later, it will cause 
a halt at a register access.
