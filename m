I must have been asleep last time I looked at this.  I was looking at
Tree RCU.  Please accept my apologies for my lapse.  :-/

However, Tiny RCU's call_rcu() also avoids enabling IRQs, so I would
have said the same thing, albeit after looking at a lot less RCU code.

TL;DR:

1.	Try making the __setup_irq() function's call to mutex_lock()
	instead be as follows:

	if (!mutex_trylock(&desc->request_mutex))
		mutex_lock(&desc->request_mutex);

	This might fail if __setup_irq() has other dependencies on a
	fully operational scheduler.

2.	Move that ppc32 call to __setup_irq() much later, most definitely
	after interrupts have been enabled and the scheduler is fully
	operational.  Invoking mutex_lock() before that time is not a
	good idea.  ;-)

For more detail, please read on!

Yes, because RCU eventually needs a context switch in order to make
a grace period happen.  And Maple Tree isn't the only thing invoking
call_rcu() early, so this has been in place for a very long time.

Here you mean IRQs being enabled upon return from __setup_irq(), correct?

But yes, __setup_irq() does call mutex_lock().  Which will call
preempt_schedule_common() via might_sleep() and __cond_resched(), even
though that is clearly a very bad thing this early.  And let's face it,
the whole purpose of mutex_lock() is to block when needed.  And a big
purpose of that might_sleep() is to yell at people invoking this with
interrupts disabled.

And most of the wrappers around __setup_irq() look to be intended
for much later, after interrupts have been enabled.  One exception is
setup_percpu_irq(), which says that it is for "the early boot process",
whenever that might be.  But this is only invoked from mips in v6.5.

The __request_percpu_irq() function is wrappered by request_percpu_irq(),
and its header comment suggests that it is to be called after there are
multiple CPUs.  I am not seeing a call that is obviously from ppc32,
but there are a number of drivers using this with which I am unfamiliar.

The request_percpu_nmi() has to be followed up on each CPU using
prepare_percpu_nmi() and enable_percpu_nmi(), so it is not clear that
it is useful to invoke this before interrupts are enabled.  But this is
used by ARM, not ppc32 from what I can see.

So even though I am not seeing how ppc32 invokes __setup_irq() early,
your testing clearly indicates that it is doing so.

Maybe something like this in __setup_irq(), right before the
mutex_lock()?

	WARN_ON_ONCE(irqs_disabled());

This will dump the stack trace showing how __setup_irq() is being invoked
in early boot on ppc32.

Again, given that __setup_irq() invokes mutex_lock(), invoking this
function in its current form before interrupts have been enabled is a
bad idea.

Tree RCU can rely on the grace-period kthread starting up later in boot.
This kthread will handle any need for a grace period from early boot
invocation of call_rcu().  Tiny RCU does not have such a kthread, hence
the resched_cpu().  Which is fine, as long as nothing (incorrectly!)
invokes a blocking operation before the scheduler has been initialized.

This might be a failure of imagination on my part, but I certainly don't
see why ppc32 should expect to get away with invoking __setup_irq()
anywhere near that early!  ;-)

But if ppc32 cannot be adjusted so as to invoke __setup_irq() later,
the following change to __setup_irq() might work:

	if (!mutex_trylock(&desc->request_mutex))
		mutex_lock(&desc->request_mutex);

The reason for "might" rather than "will" is that __setup_irq() might
well have other dependencies on the scheduler being up and running.

It would be cleaner for that ppc32 call to __setup_irq() to be moved
later, after the scheduler is up and running.

That is a perfectly legal time and place for a call_rcu() invocation.
It is also legal before rcu_init(), but it has to be late enough that
things like per-CPU variables are accessible.  Which is still very early.

Again, apologies for having misread that .config snippet!!!
