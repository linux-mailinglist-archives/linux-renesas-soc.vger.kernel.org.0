Hi Jacopo,

Thanks for this refresh. The key part here is the refresh of the
V4L2-Mux series, which is what had previously blocked the GMSL series.

Will you post/publish the vl42-mux series on the linux-media mailinglist?

I know there are other interested parties who are looking at such topics
- so highlighting the latest version might be beneficial to promoting
discussions.

Thanks, I can confirm that the rebase to current master was successful
(based on your branch with the version of patches based on my gmsl/v5)


As we now have two forks of the GMSL I'm going to rebase these such that
the separation between current topics is clear:

 - MAX9286 with support for a single camera (and only a single MAX9286)
	- This we could/should hope to get upstream
 - MAX9286 VC support
	- (requires the V4L2-Mux support of course)
 - MAX9286 dual device workaround (not suitable for upstream currently)
	- Required to function on the Salvator-XS GMSL board.

Once I've done (and tested this) I'll make a new posting (should we call
this v6? or v6.1?)


In the meantime, I will not be making changes to the RDACM20, so if you
wish to get started investigating the separation topic here - then I
don't think you are blocked on me.

Kieran
