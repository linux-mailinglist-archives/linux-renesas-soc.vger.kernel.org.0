I have an opinion :)  I think splitting this up into four files is way
more complicated than it needs to be.  This is all for driving a
single piece of hardware, and I don't think there's enough benefit to
split it into separate files.

Most drivers, even those that support both host and endpoint mode, are
in a single file, e.g., pcie-artpec6.c, pci-imx6.c, pcie-keembay.c,
pcie-tegra194.c, pci-dra7xx.c, pci-keystone.c.

That makes the Makefile very simple and there's only one module name
to worry about.

Yes.  I'm trying to move away from "msleep(100)" for everybody so we
can make sure all the drivers include the appropriate delays and
they're all based on the same reasoning.

It's good to use names from the datasheet.  The comments should be
enough.
