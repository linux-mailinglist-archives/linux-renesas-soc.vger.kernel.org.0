Hello,

Here is a short series bringing support for Renesas NAND controller
found on R-Car Gen3 and RZ/N1 SoCs.

The driver has been tested with a fully-upstream device tree on top of a
v5.16-rc4. The DT used is very close to the r9a06g032-db.

Cheers,
Miqu√®l

Changes in v6:
* Added Geert's R-by on the DT patch.
* Changed all the naming due to Wolfram's feedback. This controller is
  also found on the R-Car Gen3 family. Hence I used a much more generic
  name for the driver, the bindings, the variables, etc. The bindings
  have been updated to match the two different SoC families as well.
* Updated the MODULE_LICENSE macro as suggested by Wolfram.
 
Changes in v5:
* Add Rob's ack on the bindings.
* Dropped the #address/size-cells properties (handled by nand-controller.yaml).
* Fixed a typo reported by the kernel test robot (when building as a module).

Changes in v4:
* Set unevaluatedProperties set to false in the bindings.
* Change the clock names by removing the nand_ prefix which is
  redundant, even though the clocks are named like this in the spec. The
  name remains clear enough anyway.

Changes in v3:
* Rebased on top of a fully-upstream recent kernel.
* Renamed the clocks in the bindings and the driver to match the
  documentation (lower-cased): nand_hclk & nand_eclk.
* Added a new commit describing the NAND controller in the r9a06g032
  DTSI.
* Added the Reviewed-by and Tested-by tags received.

Changes in v2:
* Added the family-specific rzn1 compatible as suggested by Geert.
  Updated the bindings, the binding file name, the compatible used in
  the driver, the MAINTAINERS entry, etc.
* Added an ARCH_RENESAS Kconfig dependency.
* Changed the type (to unsigned) of a couple of variables.
* Returned earlier when possible to reduce indentation.
* Used platform_get_irq_optional() instead of platform_get_irq() to avoid
  a useless warning.
* Handled probe deferral correctly.
* Applied a massive s/nfc/nandc/ as suggested by Geert to avoid
  confusions with the near-field-communication device.
* Mentioned Evatronix as original authors of the IP in the commit log and
  in the header.
* Added an additional check on the validity of the child nodes reg property.
* A couple of style fixes.
