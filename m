I don't think the above series has too much impact on this. It's my
other series dealing with dma masks that's relevant because for dma
masks we only ever look at the first dma-ranges entry. We either have
to support multiple addresses and sizes per device (the only way to
really support any possible dma-ranges), merge entries to single
offset/mask or have some way to select which range entry to use.

So things are broken to some extent regardless unless MAX_NR_INBOUND_MAPS == 1.

Defining more dma-ranges entries than the h/w has inbound windows for
sounds like a broken DT to me.

What exactly does dma-ranges contain in this case? I'm not really
visualizing how different clients would pick different dma-ranges
entries.
