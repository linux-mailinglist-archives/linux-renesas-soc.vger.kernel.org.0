Doing early-boot call_rcu() is OK.

The initial thread eventually becomes the idle thread for the boot CPU.
See rest_init() in init/main.c.

I can certainly make Tiny call_rcu() refrain from invoking resched_cpu()
during boot, as shown in the (untested) patch below.  This might result in
boot-time hangs, though.

The thought of doing mutex_lock() before interrupts are enabled on the
boot CPU strikes me as very wrong.  Others might argue that the fact
that __might_resched() explicitly avoids complaining when system_state
is equal to SYSTEM_BOOTING constitutes evidence that such calls are OK.
(Which might be why enabling debug suppressed the problem.)  Except that
if you actually try sleeping at that time, nothing good can possibly
happen.

So my question is why is it useful to setup interrupts that early, given
that interrupts cannot possibly happen until the boot CPU enables them?

Stranger things have happened, but I agree that this would indeed be
quite strange!  ;-)
