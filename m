I agree it's annoying, but we'll have a similar problem, just the other
way around, with an endpoint defined in the SoC dtsi. Many R-Car SoCs
have two LVDS encoders, and you can attach a panel to either of them.
Some boards use LVDS0, some boards use LVDS1, and some boards could even
use both.

A real solution for this problem will require a new concept. The "DT
connector" proposal is related to this problem space. There's also a
proprietary implementation in the Rapsberry Pi boot loader of a
mechanism to support parametrized overlays ([2] and [3], or [4] for an
example of how a panel reset or backlight GPIO can be parametrized).
