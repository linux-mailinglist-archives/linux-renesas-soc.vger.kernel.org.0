I agree. My patch description here failed to explain the actual issue,
which is missing hardware descriptions. Here's what I understand. An
ethernet-controller is a MAC. For the MAC to work properly with its link
partner, at least one of these must be described:
- pointer to a PHY to retrieve link information from the PHY
- pointer to a PCS to retrieve link information from the PCS
- pointer to an SFP to retrieve link information from the SFP
- static link information

Andrew under the discussion of patch 7 said that enforcing this may expose
bugs on MAC drivers that never looked at the devicetree to control the
MAC's link which would cause regressions, implying we should hold back on
enforcing it. I've agreed not to enforce it, not because it is incorrect
description of ethernet controller hardware - I think it is correct - but
because I won't be the one to deal with the regressions when this
dt-bindings change goes through.

I won't also enforce it selectively, as saying "these drivers use
phylink_fwnode_phy_connect() therefore there won't be any bad surprises on
the hardware they control so let's enforce it only for them" is nonsense in
the context of describing hardware.

I will focus on documenting the missing MDIO bus descriptions on certain
ethernet switches and converting ethernet switch documents (maybe ethernet
controllers too) to json-schema. There's the incorrect link descriptions on
dsa-port.yaml as confirmed by Vladimir on the discussion of v1 series so
I'll fix that.

I've also got some ethernet controller rules that I think won't break any
driver so I will submit them as well.
