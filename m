Not necessarily. If your controller is programmed correctly with just
the ranges that are valid, then it will filter out at least the accesses
outside of valid memory. If it is programmed incorrectly, as you
suggest, then the accesses will go through, causing undefined behavior.

And note that there is such weird buggy PCI hardware. A slightly
unrelated example are some of the ath9k, which are generating spurious
MSIs even if they are in legacy PCI IRQ mode. If the controller is
configured correctly, even those buggy cards work, because it can filter
the spurious MSIs out. If not, they do not.

That's why I would prefer to configure the controller correctly, not
just hope that nothing bad will come out of misconfiguring it slightly.

And in that 1% of cases, we are OK with failure which could have been
easily prevented if the controller was programmed correctly ? That does
not look like a good thing.
