Here is the current state of my GMSL v6 platform support which applies on top
of the recently posted MAX9286 driver.

These patches are marked RFC as they are not yet intended for integration, but
are posted to allow review and to build upon them with work that is currently
in progress by Jacopo.

This includes the RDACM20 driver which we still would like to refactor further
before posting to mainline (and we probably need max9286 to land or settle for
that too)

Included in this series are a few debug patches and workarounds.

I would specifically like to know if there is value in integrating:
  "[10/13] media: i2c: max9286: Introduce a debugfs layer"

directly into the max9286 driver, as I think there will be benefits to
developers to be able to expose state and statistics from this device.

The patch:
 "[01/13] media: i2c: max9286: Add GPIO chip controller"

Is currently blocked while we decide whether we should create this as an MFD
device - but expresses a means to expose the GPIO lines from the MAX9286 as a
GPIO controller directly.

These patches (and a few more specific debug patches, and configuration of 'my'
specific camera layout) are also available at:

 git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/kbingham/rcar.git
 Branch: gmsl/dev
