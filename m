It's the exact opposite of what you just described -- the last release
of U-Boot currently populates a subset of the DMA ranges, not a
superset. The dma-ranges in the Linux DT currently are a superset of
available DRAM on the platform.

Again, this is exactly the other way around, the dma-ranges populated by
U-Boot cover only existing DRAM. The single dma-range in Linux DT covers
even the holes without existing DRAM.

So even if the Linux dma-ranges handling changes, there should be no
problem.
