Is this the U-Boot patch you refer to:

https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/1129436/

As pci_set_region is called with the same address for PCI and CPU memory
this implies there is a 1:1 mapping - therefore I don't see a need for
multiple mappings for each DRAM bank. (Also if this controller has a
32 bit limitation, shouldn't this code limit the addresses before calling
pci_set_region?).

Thanks,
