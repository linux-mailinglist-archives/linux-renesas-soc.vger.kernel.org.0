More details are in one of my earlier comments to this patch which
Yoshihiro promised to add to the patch log on the next patchset
revision. You can read it here:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20230721074452.65545-1-yoshihiro.shimoda.uh@renesas.com/T/#m8ac364249f40c726da88316b67f11a6d55068ef0

That's the point of my comment. There is no need in copying that mask
to the dw_pcie_link_set_max_link_width() method because first it's
unrelated to the link-width setting, second it's redundant. There is
my patch dropping the mask with the proper justification:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20230611192005.25636-6-Sergey.Semin@baikalelectronics.ru/
It would be good to either merge it in before the Yoshihiro' series or
add my patch to the Yoshihiro' patchset. But it's in the patchwork
limbo now, neither you nor Lorenzo or Krzysztof were willing to merge
it in. That's why I suggested to move the patch here with the denoted
alterations. Could you give your resolution whether the suggested
movement is ok or perhaps you or Lorenzo or Krzysztof consider merge
it in as is?

Note this and the next Yoshihiro' patches aren't considered as fixes
for now.

Ah, sorry. It was my incomplete text. Part of it somehow was dropped from the
message so it turned out to look as a signature. My message was in
response to the Yoshihiro' worry regarding your email:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20230612154127.GA1335023@bhelgaas/
What I was saying is that my patch didn't contain anything which could prevent
it from being merged in. So at least the patch content could be easily
copied to his series.
