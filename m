Well, my point was the opposite: why would we need to maintain a dead,
redundant code which also unrelated to the function it's being copied
to, meanwhile there is already available patch which drops that code
and Yoshihiro needs to resubmit a new revision of his series anyway?
It would have been much better to just merge in my patch/change
somehow (with another authorship if that's the problem) and forget
about that from now on. If you get to merge in the Yoshohiro patchset
first, my patch won't be cleanly applicable after that.
