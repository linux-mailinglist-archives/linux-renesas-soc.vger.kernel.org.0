The "id" is just a unique number, it is "managed" by the thing that is
creating the devices themselves, not the aux core code.  I don't see why
the i2c bus number has to match the same number that the ti driver
creates, it could be anything, as long as it doesn't match anything else
currently created by that driver.

If we had the aux core code create the id, it would just use a unique
counter, and that would not reflect any mapping to anything, so I don't
see how that is any different here.
