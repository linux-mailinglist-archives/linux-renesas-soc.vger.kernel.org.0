Ok, we are down to DT bindings interpretation then.

By the time this series:

https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/user/todo/linux-pci/?series=132419

is merged, your policy will require the host controller driver to
remove the DMA ranges that could not be programmed in the inbound
address decoders from the dma_ranges list, otherwise things will
fall apart.

See above, it depends on how the dma-ranges property is interpreted,
hopefully we can reach consensus in this thread, I won't merge a patch
that can backfire later unless we all agree that what it does is
correct.
