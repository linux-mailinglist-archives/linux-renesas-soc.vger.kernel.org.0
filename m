I'd like to make this clear. We're only talking about deviating from proper
devicetree bindings so that it won't cause too much work or not at all to
fix the incorrect Linux driver policies.

As long as we don't collectively agree on fixing the drivers to work with
proper devicetree bindings, I'd keep the missing ethernet controller
bindings (requiring at least one of PHY, PCS, SFP, fixed-link) as they
currently are on ethernet-controller.yaml, optional. Or rather, I wouldn't
touch anything regarding this as it's nonsensical to change devicetree
bindings because of driver policies.

As you have pointed out with certain examples, once the driver starts
operating out of what the devicetree says, in other words, once the driver
starts guessing the hardware, there's no guarantee it will always guess it
correctly. As seen with the macb driver, the driver assumes that if there's
no phy-handle property, the PHY on its MDIO bus must be used regardless.
But the MAC may be connected to another MAC, PCS or SFP, meaning it doesn't
use the PHY on that bus.

There is also a case for DSA. If there's an implication that the DSA
controlled switch has an MDIO bus (phy_read() and phy_write()), the DSA
driver will connect the switch MACs to the PHYs on the MDIO bus of the
switch, even if there's no description of that MDIO bus on the devicetree.
As unlikely as it is on a real life scenario, there may be a device that
has its switch MACs wired to the PHYs on another MDIO bus.

This is why I've proposed to make the drivers strictly follow what the
devicetree says.

Agreed.
