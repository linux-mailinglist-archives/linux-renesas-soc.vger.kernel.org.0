I think it should. Otherwise, how do you know if the region is 32 or 64 
bit or prefetchable or not?

You aren't adding 'BAR0 region', but something else. Based on the name, 
cfg_res, that is config space? That seems wrong both in requiring it to 
be registered and that you would assign BAR0 to config space. How would 
that device operate when config space is not memory mapped?

For compatibility, the change itself doesn't look so bad. However, we 
could also fixup the DT itself. That's not done too much on Arm systems, 
but there's all sorts of fixups in powerpc. I have some initial 
infrastructure to support that if we need to go down that path.

If it is config space, no, I don't think ranges should cover that. 
'ranges' should have all the memory and io spaces.

You've exceeded my PCI knowledge on this...
