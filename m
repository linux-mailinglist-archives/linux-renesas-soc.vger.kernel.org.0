Yes, I agree with you on that.

The idea was taking the address from the host controller inbound window
(ie an address outside the dma-ranges ~(dma-ranges) and < 4GB), it
should not matter which one. I agree though that this can be a
subsequent patch even though usually we send for -rc* only fixes for
patches that hit the previous merge window - this seems a quite
longstanding (I traced it back to v3.16) one so it would wait till
v5.12, there is time to refactor it.
