Separate files makes sense because different modes will want to 
include different common schemas. We've generally been doing different 
compatibles too which makes validating the node has the right set of 
properties easier.

That would be strange for a memory range.

Sounds like like 'ranges' though I'm not sure if 'ranges' for an EP 
makes sense or what that should look like.
