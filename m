I checked again DBAT before point [1] and after point [3]. Before point [1]
DBAT=0x6c040000, after point [3] DBAT=0x00000000.

However, if all the register settings done before point [1] are re-executed
after point [3] the Ethernet connection seems usable. I tried the above
settings after point [3] to confirm this:

        ravb_set_config_mode(ndev);

        usleep_range(1000, 2000);

        pr_err("%s(): 2: mode=%08x\n", __func__, ravb_read(ndev, CSR));



        if (info->gptp || info->ccc_gac) {

                /* Set GTI value */

                error = ravb_set_gti(ndev);

                if (error)

                        goto out_disable_refclk;



                /* Request GTI loading */

                ravb_modify(ndev, GCCR, GCCR_LTI, GCCR_LTI);

        }



        if (info->internal_delay) {

                ravb_parse_delay_mode(np, ndev);

                ravb_set_delay_mode(ndev);

        }



        ravb_write(ndev, priv->desc_bat_dma, DBAT);



        /* Initialise PTP Clock driver */

        ravb_wait(ndev, GCCR, GCCR_TCR, GCCR_TCR_NOREQ);

        ravb_modify(ndev, GCCR, GCCR_TCSS, GCCR_TCSS_ADJGPTP);


However, I don't have a PTP setup to check.

All is good in RZ/G3S. MSTOP is set accordingly and no issues.
