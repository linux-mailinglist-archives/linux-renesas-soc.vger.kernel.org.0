I did some more testing, and there seems to be a similar issue with
DMA controllers, which I hadn't really noticed before, as I have
DMAC drivers built-in in all my kernel configs.  If the (optional)
DMAC driver is not available, you need "fw_devlink=permissive" to make
drivers probe devices that have (optional) DMA support.
Interestingly, that is not the case with (optional) IOMMU support:
drivers do probe devices that have (optional) DMA support when the
latter is not available.

It does print wrong and confusing warnings indicating the problem:

    genpd_provider ca57-cpu0: sync_state() pending due to fe000000.pcie

(no, the PCIe controller is not part of the CPU PM Domain)

if it would be just coarse-grained, the link should be created to a
device representing the controller, not to the device representing
the first PM domain.

Doesn't the pmdomain core create a device for each PM domain, so the
index could be used to link to the correct domain?

Yep, like before.

I also had a closer look at the few pending sync_state() pending
warnings I do see on SH/R-Mobile SoCs.  Their PM Domain driver uses
of_genpd_add_provider_simple() instead of of_genpd_add_provider_onecell().
E.g. on R-Mobile A1:

    genpd_provider a3sm: sync_state() pending due to f0100000.cache-controller
    genpd_provider a4s: sync_state() pending due to fe400000.memory-controller
    genpd_provider d4: sync_state() pending due to ptm

All three domains were already handled specially in the PM Domain
driver, as they must not be turned off, so these platforms didn't
regress due to this series.

Thanks!
