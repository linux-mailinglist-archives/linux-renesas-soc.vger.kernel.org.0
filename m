One line of code is not "covered by plasters".  There are no plasters.
It's a solution that works for 99.99% of people, unlike your approach
that has had a stream of issues over the last four months, and has
required many reworks of the code to fix each one.  That in itself
speaks volumes about the suitability of the approach.

Right, so DT is correct.

So you want to throw yet more complexity at this solution to try and
make it work...

It's hardly fragile when it's worked fine for the last 20+ years,
whereas your solution can't work without some regression being reported
within a couple of weeks of it being applied.  Again, that speaks
volumes about which one is better than the other.

Continually patching this approach to workaround one issue after another
shows that it is _this_ solution that is the fragile implementation.

A fragile implementation is by definition one that keeps breaking.
That's yours.  The masking approach hasn't "broken" for anyone, and
hasn't been the cause of one single regression anywhere.  Yes, there
are some platforms that it doesn't work for (because they choose to
reserve the first chunk of RAM for something) but that is not a
regression.

So, I'm not going to apply the next revision of this patch for at least
one whole kernel cycle - that means scheduling it for 5.10-rc at the
earliest.
