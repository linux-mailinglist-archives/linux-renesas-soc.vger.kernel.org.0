Thanks Nico for coming back with this information. To me, it looks
like the patch may be applicable to some Renesas' downstream kernel
then.

In my opinion I think we should rather try to revert, to avoid any
further problems. So I am going to send that patch and see what people
think about it.

Another option, which Sudeep doesn't seem very happy about too, is to
make the GENPD_FLAG_PM_CLK conditional, based on a platform
compatible.

Kind regards
Uffe
