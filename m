With legacy IRQs.

They do not, the point was, there is such broken hardware so the
controller should be programmed correctly.

It's the best effort thing to do. It's well possible the next generation
of the controller will have more windows, so could accommodate the whole
list of ranges.

Thinking about this further, this patch should be OK either way, if
there is a DT which defines more DMA ranges than the controller can
handle, handling some is better than failing outright -- a PCI which
works with a subset of memory is better than PCI that does not work at all.

Do you have any further details about this ?
