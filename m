- Philippe, email address is no longer valid.

I have access, however
 - Philippe is long gone from Toradex and he was the one looking into
   this topic
 - we did solve the issue in a different way, e.g. we no longer
   power-off the phy in suspend

Therefore is not straightforward to provide valuable feedback to you
now.

Is something like that fine?
Don't we need to reconfigure the ethernet phy completely on resume
if we do reset it? kszphy_config_reset() is taking care of something,
but I think that the phy being reset on resume is not handled
correctly.
