For whatever definition of "all"? Does this include e.g. all
multi-media stuff?

For Renesas ARM SoCs, we make sure to select the critical core parts,
cfr. the selects above, and in drivers/soc/renesas/Kconfig.
These selects do not include optional drivers, including the serial
port (cfr. your confusion about adding CONFIG_SERIAL_SH_SCI=y
to the defconfig).
All the rest is handled by the defconfigs (shmobile_defconfig on
arm32, single defconfig on arm64, and out-of-tree renesas_defconfig
in my renesas-devel tree).

Ah, there is my good reason for registering for LPC ;-)
