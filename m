I can't confirm for sure that the BARs manipulations in this patch
will work on the older IP-cores (prior 5.10a) or will be required for
all new controllers (5.10a and newer). Based on the BARs description
posted in the IP-core HW manuals, the CSRs semantic has changed
between the major releases. Old DW PCIe RC IP-core HW-manuals
explicitly state that the BARs are unavailable:

"The Synopsys core does not implement the optional BARs for the RC
product"

New DW PCIe RC IP-cores manual say that the BARs exist, but are
normally unused:

"Two BARs are present but are not expected to be used. You should
disable them to avoid unnecessary memory assignment during device
enumeration. If you do use a BAR, then you should program it to
capture TLPs that are targeted to your local non-application memory
space.... The BAR range must be outside of the three Base/Limit
regions..."

So in theory it's possible to have platforms with the BARs somehow
utilized even in the Root Ports. Though currently AFAICS we don't
have such devices supported in kernel.

AFAIR Yoshihiro insisted to have the BARs reset because without
it something didn't work, so he added some comment to justify it:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/TYBPR01MB534104389952D87385E8745ED8879@TYBPR01MB5341.jpnprd01.prod.outlook.com/
Though based on the comment the BARs reset still seems optional.

One more low-level driver which already does what is implemented in
this patch is the Keystone PCI host-controller driver (see,
pci-keystone.c also activates dbi_cs2 and zeros out the
PCI_TYPE0_BAR0_ENABLED flag). Moreover something similar is done in
the generic DW PCIe EP driver in the framework of the
__dw_pcie_ep_reset_bar() method including the direct BARs zeroing out
(which I questioned in my initial message in this thread). So seeing
this patch would re-do what is already done for the Keystone device
and would add a partly duplicated code it would be reasonable to drop
the patch for now and get the BARs reset back to the Rcar host
low-level driver as it was in v23. We can get back to the topic
afterward and see whether the BARs reset could be done generically for
the RPs. If we figure out that it's required at least for the new
controllers then we'll be able to implement a generic RP/EP BARs reset
method, have it utilized in both DW PCIe core drivers and drop the
respective code from both Rcar and Keystone LLDDs.
