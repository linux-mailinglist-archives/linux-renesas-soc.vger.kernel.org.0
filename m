That does not match with what I am seeing: before this patch, there
was no delay on first data access from user space, as the drive is fully
spun up when system resume returns.
With this patch, system resume returns earlier, and the drive is only
spun up when user space starts accessing data.

Note that I do not have any file system mounted, and use
"hd /dev/sda | head -70" to access the disk.

Unfortunately that didn't work, as /dev/sda no longer exists.
Will reply to the patch I bisected the issue to...
