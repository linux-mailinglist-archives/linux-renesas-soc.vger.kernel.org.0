When controller stucks in some "unknown" state you have a problem. And
it does not matter if you are doing MMIO or not. If controller is in
Recovery or Configuration state then endpoint card cannot send neither
interrupt nor memory read / write messages to system.

Driver for endpoint card does not have to do active polling to check if
something in endpoint card happened. It can just wait for interrupt and
then do some stuff (which is IIRC preferred design if events are not too
frequent). And in this case card is in dead state and you have this
problem, right?

No, I asked what happen when is *not* in L state. Commit message does
not describe it.

So what happen if you try to do MMIO e.g. during Hot Reset state? (This
state can be easily "forced", so easy to test) Does it crash too (and
therefore needs some other "hack")? Or it is working fine without any
crash? Read operation in most cases returns all-ones and write just do
nothing (as write has no response).

For R-Car it then fine. This was just general comment as arm32 is still
actively developed platform.
