I do not think this is off-topic. Issue here is caused when controller
is not in L0 state and this test is something which deterministically
put controller into non-L0 state (Hot Reset). The best verification of
all race conditions and similar timing problems is to to setup scenario
in which timing windows can be under full control. Which this can can
do.

I saw more issues related to PCIe slave errors and I'm feeling that this
patch is just hacking one or two consequences and not fixing the source
of the problem globally.

In most cases slave errors are (incorrectly) reported to CPU when PCIe
controller receive UR/CA response from the bus or if controller itself
generate UR/CA response for request from CPU.

Moreover if this test shows that PCI Bridge registers do not work
properly then it is something which must be fixed too.

There were more discussions about catching and recovering from ARM CPU
aborts and all patches for catching asynchronous exceptions were
rejected because they cannot work by their _imprecise_ nature.

And also there were discussions (not sure if on ML or IRC) if the PCI
core / drivers are the correct place for ARMv7 exceptions / data aborts.
