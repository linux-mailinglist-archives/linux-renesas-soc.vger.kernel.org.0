The driver needs to complete the switch from L0 to L1 link state, yes.

Yes, because the link is in this inbetween state. So you need 3) to
complete that transition.

That's because this patch adds it.

Yes

Power saving I would say.

This is the Trusted Firmware from ARM, in this case it behaves similar
to ACPI. See e.g.:

https://github.com/ARM-software/arm-trusted-firmware/commit/0969397f295621aa26b3d14b76dd397d22be58bf
