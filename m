Right, and it's important that the kernel decompresses to 0x18008000
so it doesn't overwrite memory that was being used by the crashing
kernel, and thus can create a true coredump image of the failed
kernel.  Meanwhile, the DTB still needs to describe the full memory
layout so that we know where memory is located in order to coredump
it properly.

So, this is a flaw with this approach, and will need the commit to be
dropped yet again - this patch is fundamentally incompatible with the
way kexec's crashdump works.

Looking back at the history, we've been trying this approach since
February with four patches submitted to the patch system, and problems
eventually found with each of them.  I think this shows that the way
the decompressor works out where to decompress the kernel to today is
relied upon all over the place, and changing it is always going to
cause problems.  So, I don't think we /can/ change it without causing
a regression for someone.
