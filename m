It is working as long as either hardware delivers interrupt signal without inversion, or only one side 
(producer or consumer) is configured while the other side stays constant.

It does not work when hardware inverts singnal and both producer and consumer are configured.

Could you please explain how this could be done?

Regardless of what is configured at endpoint side, interrupt controller driver will use that to set up 
interrupt controller, and wl18xxx driver (in the case) will use that to configure wl18xx. That results 
into SAME settings at producer and consumer sides, and hardware requires OPPOSITE sittings at producer 
and consumer sides.

It is not a problem in interrupt controller driver - that driver does it's job correctly, setting up the 
interrupt type that is requested.

It is likely not a problem in interrupt source (i.e. wl18xx) driver - that driver tries to set up it's 
irq in the way that will work with any interrupt controller. Perhaps it can be possible to update wl18xx 
driver to allow fixed setup of interrupt polarity, but that looks like addressing problem at wrong 
location. It is not an issue with wl18xx. There are quite a few drivers in the tree that setup interrupt 
polarity for their devices based on what irq_get_trigger_type() returns.

The root cause if the issue is the board itself, that inverts the signal. Thus it looks correct to tie 
the fix to the board. And a device node describing the interconnect looks like an elegant solution for this.

Code works with #interrupt-cells=0 correctly, as long as interrupts-extended property is used at 
producer side.

No. It is an attempt to describe a case that seems to be not currently describable.

Vendor BSPs solve this by commenting out irq polarity setup in drivers. Thus obviously breaking use 
cases other than these BSPs are for. I'm trying to suggest a portable alternative instead.

The goal is - make irq_get_trigger_type() returning different values for producer and consumer of the 
interrupt. Because, that matches the hardware behavior.

While irq_get_trigger_type() is used for that, returning different values for producer and consumer is 
obviously impossible.

Originally, I was considering to add a different API to use by interrupt producer instead of 
irq_get_trigger_type(), to deliver information configured by additional flag in DT node for interrupt 
producer. I.e.
     interrupts = <25 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING | IRQ_INVERTED_ROUTE>

But, inverted route is not a feature of interrupt, it is a feature of connection. I.e. nothing stops 
from having several sources routed to the same interrupt, and having only one of these sources inverted. 
This means, the IRQ_INVERTED_ROUTE flag is not interrupt's flag but connection's flag. And, a virtual 
irqchip looked like a good abstraction to describe connection.

The fact that this make the entire solution much smaller, was just a pleasant side-effect ;).

I've learned the idea of calling generic_handle_irq() from interrupt handler from 
Documentation/driver-api/gpio/driver.rst

It looked as an elegant solution to avoid complexity (such as: a chained interrupt is activated at 
registration time, assuming there is a piece of hardware [chained controller] that will avoid interrupt 
firing until a chained source fires...  but for pure-software chained interrupt, must keep parent 
disabled up to when a handler for child is installed)

But, I definitely don't insist on this approach.

Could you please point me to such examples? I could not find any.

Thanks,
