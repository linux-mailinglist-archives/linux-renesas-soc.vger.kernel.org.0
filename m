OK to sum it up, this patch is there to deal with u-boot adding multiple
dma-ranges to DT. I still do not understand the benefit given that for
DMA masks they are useless as Rob pointed out and ditto for inbound
windows programming (given that AFAICS the PCI controller filters out
any transaction that does not fall within its inbound windows by default
so adding dma-ranges has the net effect of widening the DMA'able address
space rather than limiting it).

In short, what's the benefit of adding more dma-ranges regions to the
DT (and consequently handling them in the kernel) ?
