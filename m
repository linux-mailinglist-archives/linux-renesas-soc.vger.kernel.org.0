Hmm, I think that was already implemented in some of the serieses out 
there (or even in mainline already?), as I remember doing some 
experiments with it. I don't like it much, though.

With a simple timeout, it'll always be just a bit too early for some 
user (nfs mount took a bit more time than expected -> board frozen).

The only condition I can see that would somewhat work is a manual 
trigger from the userspace. The boot scripts could then signal the 
kernel when all the modules have been loaded and probably a suitable, 
platform/use case specific amount of time has passed to allow the 
drivers to probe.

It just feels a bit too much of a "let's hope this work" approach.

That said, the timeout/condition is probably acceptable for many cases, 
where turning off a resource forcefully will just result in, say, a 
temporarily blanked display, or something else that gets fixed if and 
when the proper driver is probed.

Unfortunately, here with the case I have, the whole board gets halted if 
the display subsystem genpd is turned off and the display driver is 
loaded after that.
