Well, after the deferred probe timeout, the missing supplier depency
should be ignored even if you don't have "permissive".

Typically we get a print in the log that could say:
"pm-test-drv pm_test24: deferred probe timeout, ignoring dependency"

... and then the driver-core tries probing the device anyway. It's
then up to the consumer driver to allow probing to succeed, even if
the DMA setup procedure fails.

Okay, so some special treatments are already in place for IOMMUs, to
allow them to probe sooner, I guess. I don't know in detail how this
works, maybe Saravana can help to fill in?

Although my guess is that, by allowing IOMMUs to probe like this,
means that these drivers need to manage the DMA setup quite
differently.

The DMA driver (supplier) may probe and become available *after* the
IOMMU driver has probed. In other words, the IOMMU drivers then need
to manage the DMA setup even beyond probing.

That's a good point. We should fix this to avoid confusion.

Correct, we have a device associated for each PM domain - and when
of_genpd_add_provider_onecell() is called, we get the index associated
for each of them.

If I understand your proposal, you are suggesting that genpd itself
creates the device_link between its corresponding device (supplier)
and the upcoming consumer device(s), at the point when
of_genpd_add_provider_onecell() is called, right?

It's an interesting idea, but I am not sure it will work. To create
the device_link at this point, assumes that all the consumer OF-nodes
have been populated (to have devices available for them). Maybe there
is an intermediate step we can take to instruct fw_devlink to treat
these "links" differently?

Saravana, any thoughts around this?

Okay!

Again the prints are confusing and annoying, but in principle we are
fine. Thanks for clarifying!

This also makes me wonder if we should skip enabling the fw_devlink
support for those genpds with "simple" providers that are special
(GENPD_FLAG_ALWAYS_ON and GENPD_FLAG_RPM_ALWAYS_ON). It doesn't make
sense to track consumers for them, I think.
