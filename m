We could do this by adding a label to the port instead of the endpoint
in the SoC .dtsi.

lvds0: lvds@.... {
	...

	ports {
		port@0 {
			lvds0_in: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&du_out_lvds0>;
			};
		};

		lvds_out_panel_port: port@1 {
		};
};

It would however likely be better do add the label to port@1 in the
board .dts though, as usage of a particular LVDS output is a board
property, not an SoC property.

Then, in the overlay,

panel {
	port {
		panel_in: endpoint {
			remote_endpoint <&lvds_out_panel>;
		};
	};
};

&lvds_out_panel_port {
	lvds_out_panel: endpoint {
		remote-endpoint = <&panel_in>;
	};
};

There's one caveat though: The LVDS DT nodes are disabled in the SoC
.dtsi, so the overlay would need to have

&lvds0 {
	status = "okay";
};

and that would need to reference the correct lvds node. Without
parameterized overlays, I don't think we can solve this issue neatly
(especially given that panels will often have control GPIOs, or
GPIO-controlled regulators, that could be wired to different SoC GPIOs
on different boards).

Someone to continue working on it I suppose :-)

We could use a label for the port node as shown above. It's not a
complete solution, but it may help. I'm not sure how to solve the
enabling of the lvds encoder DT node though.
