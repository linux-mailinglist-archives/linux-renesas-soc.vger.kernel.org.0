Hi folks,

I also do not consider what's happened here as normal. The maintainers
removal stands against the key principles and values of our GNU/Linux
communities and the FOSS ideology. Values and ideas most of us have been
protecting and advocating for since we can remember!

This hurt so badly! Really. This is betrial.

Even if this is now reverted, or the upstream kernel is forked and a new
upstream kernel repository is elected, the history of it will remain and
haunt us all.

Turned out our beloved and "free" as in freedom kernel has been
compromised by compliance to a government.

But this is the Linux kernel, how could this have happened?! It is used,
improved and copied all over the world, not just one country! Why did we
let this happen?

This is a precedent that tells everybody what can come next, due to
"compliance" reasons the kernel could receive code produced by a
government institution that serves not the Linux community, but the
governement.

Surely it is not just me thinking towards what can change so we never
again have to comply to a government of a country when fighting for
freedom!

FSF, any comments on this?

Resist!

+rms and fsf

Thanks,
Nikolay
