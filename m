I guess this came from arch/arm/boot/dts/renesas/r8a7791.dtsi:

                pci0: pci@ee090000 {
                        compatible = "renesas,pci-r8a7791",
                                     "renesas,pci-rcar-gen2";
                        reg = <0 0xee090000 0 0xc00>,
                              <0 0xee080000 0 0x1100>;
                        ranges = <0x02000000 0 0xee080000 0 0xee080000 0 0x00010000>;
                        bus-range = <0 0>;

                pciec: pcie@fe000000 {
                        compatible = "renesas,pcie-r8a7791",
                                     "renesas,pcie-rcar-gen2";
                        dma-ranges = <0x42000000 0 0x40000000 0 0x40000000 0 0x80000000>,
                        bus-range = <0x00 0xff>;

"reg" describes address space on a device's parent side, e.g.,
memory-mapped registers consumed by the device itself.  Since this is
a host bridge, it also has "ranges" to describe address space on its
child side, including any address translation from the parent side.

PCI devices are on the child side and should consume space from the
"ranges" child side, [mem 0xee080000-0xee08ffff] in this case.

00:00.0: BAR 0 [mem 0xee090800-0xee090bff] isn't in that child address
space so I think it's invalid per spec.  Does 00:00.0 actually respond
at whatever address is in BAR 0?  Do we care?  I don't see any driver
that claims [1033:0000].

00:00.0: BAR 1 [mem 0x40000000-0x7fffffff pref] looks like it came
from the pcie@fe000000 "dma-ranges", which describes valid child
address space for DMA.  We need to know the DMA address space, of
course, but we get it from "dma-ranges", not from a BAR.

I think it would be nicest if pci-rcar-gen2.c could hide both BAR 0
and 1 somehow so they wouldn't confuse us.

(BTW, I don't understand how both pci@ee090000 and pcie@fe000000 say
they are bridges to bus 0.)
