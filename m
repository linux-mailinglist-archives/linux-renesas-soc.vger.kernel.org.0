How do those devices work on h/w without inbound window configuration
or they don't?

How do the spurious MSIs only go to invalid addresses and not valid addresses?

Again, just handling the first N dma-ranges entries and ignoring the
rest is not 'configure the controller correctly'.

You don't need dma-ranges if you want to handle holes in DRAM. Use
memblock to get this information. Then it will work if you boot using
UEFI too.

dma-ranges at the PCI bridge should be restrictions in the PCI bridge,
not ones somewhere else in the system.
