Fair enough. I believe for (optional) "feature" the common pattern would
then be depends on FEATURE || FEATURE=n.

What annoys me is that the fixes tend to fall in two categories:

- Play catch with selecting the dependencies of the selected
  symbols. "depends on" handles this recursively, while select does
  not. There is no end to this, it just goes on and on, as the
  dependencies of the selected symbols change over time. Often the
  selects require unintuitive if patterns that are about the
  implementation details of the symbol being selected.

- Brush the invalid configs under the rug by using IS_REACHABLE(),
  switching from a loud link time failure to a silent runtime
  failure. (I regularly reject patches adding IS_REACHABLE() to i915,
  because from my pov e.g. i915=y backlight=m is an invalid
  configuration that the user shouldn't have to debug at runtime. But I
  can't express that in kconfig while everyone selects backlight.)

If you have other ideas how these should be fixed, I'm all ears.

Fair enough, though I think they still suffer from some of them having
dependencies. (Wasn't this how the original patches and the debate all
got started?)
