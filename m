Ah ok, so PD_VBATTB is like a power domain/wrapper and not an IP block
mapped on the bus at the same address as the RTC that it wraps. That
changes things a bit.

It looks like in both cases something is connected to the pins. XC is to
use an external crystal connected to both pins and XBYP is to use a
single clk. Given that, perhaps naming the clk "rtx" is simplest and
then using assigned-clock-parents is most direct because there's only
really one "logical" clk input for this device. That means the XC and
XBYP clks have the same parent, "rtx", and the XC clk is a gateable
fixed rate clk while the XBYP clk is a fixed factor clk that does
nothing besides pass on the rate of the "rtx" clk.

The docs say VBATT in some places. Not sure if you want to rename it to
vbatt and drop the extra b which probably stands for "backup"?

No, don't do that. The only change from the above DT node is that the
assigned-clocks and assigned-clock-parents property should be moved to
the RTC node.
