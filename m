I think this is where there is a difference in understanding.

If I understand correctly, the job of the dma-ranges property isn't to
describe *what* ranges the PCI device can access - it's there to describe
*how*, i.e. the mapping between PCI and CPU-visible memory.

The dma-ranges property is a side-effect of how the busses are wired up
between the CPU and PCI controller - and so it doesn't matter what is or
isn't on those buses.

It's the job of other parts of the system to ensure that PCI devices are
told the correct addresses to write to, e.g. the enumerating software
referring to a valid CPU visible address correctly translated for the view
of the PCI device, ATS etc. And any IOMMU to enforce that.

It sounds like there is a 1:1 mapping between CPU and PCI - in which case
there isn't a reason for a dma-ranges.

Thanks,
