Hi Andy!

This appears to have been added in 9e2aee80c78d ("PCI: Move private DT
related functions into private header")

Several other drivers were touched in that commit too.

Have you checked to see if any others can also be cleaned up?

 (I only ask, because I only see this single patch on linux-renesas-soc,
my apologies if others are on different lists.)

Regardless of that, this looks fine to me, and passes a cursory compile
check.

And I've just tried with pcie-xilinx, and pcie-altera, but both still
need this header - so perhaps pcie-rcar was just the odd one out.
