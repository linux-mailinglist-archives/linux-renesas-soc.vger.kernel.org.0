I'd say that depends on the actual memory configuration, i.e. does memory
exist in the gap? Does memory exist above 0x5fffffff?

BTW, reading Devicetree Specification, Release v0.2: dma-ranges
describes bus address space translation; it does not describe if the
full address space is backed by physical RAM (see the /memory node).
Hence if there's no memory in the gap, I see no reason to have 2 entries
in dma-ranges, as the translation offsets are the same, so they could be
covered by a single larger entry.
