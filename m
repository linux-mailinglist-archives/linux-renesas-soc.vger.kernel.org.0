In the future all platforms may, but I don't think that that is
particularly important here. The systems that we are talking about at
the moment do not have AIA. If there are AIA capable systems produced
using Andes' IP, one would hope that they implement Sscopmf (or w/e the
forgettable extension name is). :fingers_crossed:

I don't see what the problem with that is. It is completely unreasonable
to render custom extensions that used the resources available to them at
the time invalid for use in the kernel (unless branded as an erratum)
because later on standard extensions co-opted those resources for its
own usage.

Where we have no other choice but to use marchid et al for detecting
issues with a vendors implementation, then I have no problem with it.
If you look at any of the threads where I have objected to the use of
them, it's been specifically for the detection of features, not for
their use in dealing with implementation issues (like the sifive sfence
issues).

I don't really care for how it is exposed in hwprobe, you should ask
those responsible for the hwprobe interface what they think.

If you mean on the DT side, one of the stated goals of the new
properties was to put RVI's extensions and vendor extensions on a equal
footing.

Dunno if that answers your question,
Conor.
