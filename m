Then these gadgets ought to have distinct names in order to avoid the 
conflict below:

Having three gadget devices, all named "gadget", doesn't seem like a 
good idea.

Naturally, since the first registration succeeds and the later ones fail 
because they can't reuse the same name.

This doesn't seem like it should be too hard to fix, although I'm not 
at all familiar with the renesas-usb3 driver.  Do you know who maintains 
that driver?  Is it you?
