I think that means we cannot enable ASPM L1 at all on this device.  I
don't think devices or drivers are prepared to deal with this sort of
DMA failure.  At least, if there is a mechanism for dealing with it, I
don't know what it is.

Preventing use of ASPM L1 probably means some sort of quirk to
override whatever the controller advertises in its Link Capabilities
register.

The software-controlled PCI-PM model (where software writes to the
PCI_PM_CTRL register) is different, and it may still be possible to
use L1 then.  If software puts the device in D1, D2, or D3hot, the
device cannot initiate DMA.  If it needs to return to D0, it would
have to use the PME mechanism, so there is an opportunity for the
software workaround.

The L1 exit latency only applies to the ASPM case.  It sounds like we
will have to disable L1 for ASPM.  But the exit latency doesn't apply
to the PCI-PM model where software will explicitly return the device
to D0, and the device should not initiate a transaction until it sees
the link back in L0.
