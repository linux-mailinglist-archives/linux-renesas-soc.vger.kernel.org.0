Renesas 8T49N241 has 4 outputs, 1 integral and 3 fractional dividers.
The 8T49N241 accepts up to two differential or single-ended input clocks
and a fundamental-mode crystal input. The internal PLL can lock to either
of the input reference clocks or to the crystal to behave as a frequency
synthesizer.

+title: Binding for Renesas 8T49N241 Universal Frequency Translator
+
+description: |
+  The 8T49N241 has one fractional-feedback PLL that can be used as a
+  jitter attenuator and frequency translator. It is equipped with one
+  integer and three fractional output dividers, allowing the generation
+  of up to four different output frequencies, ranging from 8kHz to 1GHz.
+  These frequencies are completely independent of each other, the input
+  reference frequencies and the crystal reference frequency. The device
+  places virtually no constraints on input to output frequency conversion,
+  supporting all FEC rates, including the new revision of ITU-T
+  Recommendation G.709 (2009), most with 0ppm conversion error.
+  The outputs may select among LVPECL, LVDS, HCSL or LVCMOS output levels.
+
+  The driver can read a full register map from the DT, and will use that
+  register map to initialize the attached part (via I2C) when the system
+  boots. Any configuration not supported by the common clock framework
+  must be done via the full register map, including optimized settings.
+
+  The 8T49N241 accepts up to two differential or single-ended input clocks
+  and a fundamental-mode crystal input. The internal PLL can lock to either
+  of the input reference clocks or just to the crystal to behave as a
+  frequency synthesizer. The PLL can use the second input for redundant
+  backup of the primary input reference, but in this case, both input clock
+  references must be related in frequency.
+
+  All outputs are currently assumed to be LVDS, unless overridden in the
+  full register map in the DT.
