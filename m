I have a feeling that's not how Rob defined the dma-ranges in this

I think you picked a rather special case here and arrived as a DMA mask
which just fails in this special case. Such special case doesn't happen
here, and even if it did, I would expect Linux to merge those two ranges
or do something sane ? If the DMA mask is set incorrectly, that's a bug
of the DMA code I would think.

What DMA mask would you get if those two entries had a gap inbetween
them ? E.g.:

 dma-ranges = <0x00000000 0x00000000 0x20000000,
               0x40000000 0x40000000 0x20000000>;

That's what the driver does with this patchset, except it's not possible
to cover all those ranges. It covers them as well as it can.
