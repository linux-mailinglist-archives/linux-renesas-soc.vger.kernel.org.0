Not necessarily. We really only want to define the minimum we have to.
The ideal system is no dma-ranges. Is each bank at a different
relative position compared to the CPU's view of the system. That would
seem doubtful for just DRAM banks. Perhaps DRAM and SRAM could change.

I suppose if your intent is to use inbound windows as a poor man's
IOMMU to prevent accesses to the holes, then yes you would list them
out. But I think that's wrong and difficult to maintain. You'd also
need to deal with reserved-memory regions too.
