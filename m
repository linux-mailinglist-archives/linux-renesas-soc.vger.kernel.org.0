Correct.

OK I understand - At least when working on the assumption that your RC will
block RC->CPU transactions that are not described in any of it's windows.
Thus you want to use the dma-ranges as a means to configure your controller
to do this.

What actually happens if you have a broken endpoint that reads/writes to
non-existent memory on this hardware? Ideally the RC would generate a
CA or UR back to the endpoint - does something else happen? Lockup, dead RC,
performance issues?

Using built-in features of the RC to prevent it from sending transactions
to non-existent addresses is clearly helpful. But of course it doesn't stop
a broken EP from writing to existent addresses, so only provides limited
protection.

Despite the good intentions here, it doesn't seem like dma-ranges is
designed for this purpose and as the hardware has limited ranges it will
only be best-effort.
