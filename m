Please elaborate on the vague part of the specification, happy to help you
get that fixed if it really needs to be.

That is some serious issue. If there is no power, how can you expect it
to be wake up source ? Sounds something wrong fundamentally IMO.

OK, thanks for confirming.

OK, unless you are optimising, you shouldn't care then what PSCI does.
If you don't need eMMC, just suspend/power it off before you enter system/
psci suspend.

The specification states clearly:
"... all devices in the system must be in a state that is compatible
with entry into the system state. These preconditions are beyond the scope
of this specification and are therefore not described here."
"Prior to the call, the OS must disable all sources of wakeup other than
those it needs to support for its implementation of suspend to RAM."

And of course, the firmware must rely on OSPM to do proper device PM if
it is not shared resource. Trying to be aggressive and turning off all
the wakeup sources which out knowledge of it is broken firmware.

I see nothing has been fixed in the firmware too and we are still
discussing the same after 3 years ðŸ˜„. Clearly we should start trusting
firmware and built capability to fix and replace it if there are bugs
just like kernel and stop hacking around in the kernel to deal with
just broken platform/psci firmware.
