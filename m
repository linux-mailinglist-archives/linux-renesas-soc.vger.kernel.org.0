What about something like macb? The macb driver:
- attempts to connect a phy using phylink_of_phy_connect()
- if that fails, and there is no phy-handle property, then the driver
  will attempt to find the first PHY to exist on its MII bus, and will
  connect that using phylink_connect_phy().

So, in this case, if we define a phylink binding to require one of a
phy-handle node, pcs node, sfp node or static link information, then
although macb uses phylink, it then doesn't conform to this phylink
binding. (This is the only driver that uses phy_find_first() which
also uses phylink according to my greps, but I haven't checked for
any other games drivers be using.)

The same thing more or less happens with non-phylink drivers. Take a
look at drivers/net/ethernet/microchip/lan743x_main.c, and notice
that it first attempts to get a PHY from DT. If that fails, it
uses phy_find_first(). If that fails, and we have a LAN7431, then
a gigabit full-duplex fixed-link PHY is used instead. So, what macb
is doing with phylink is no different from what other drivers are
doing with phylib - and it's the driver's choice.

The same way that there are multiple drivers that don't do this,
which want a PHY device to be specified in DT if the driver was
bound to a device that was described in DT - there are phylink
and non-phylink drivers that do this.

This is exactly my point - there is *no* *such* *thing* as a phylink
binding. There is the ethernet-controller binding, which phylink
provides the ability for network drivers to optionally use, but
phylink doesn't require anything from any firmware description, except
to attach a SFP interface, or to describe a fixed-link. Everything else
is really up to the ethernet-controller aka MAC driver to decide how it
wants to deal with things.

We currently work around this by the ethernet-controller YAML having
all these properties as optional. Maybe some drivers extend that YAML
and require certain properties - that is their perogative, but that is
the driver's choice, and is a completely separate issue to whether
the driver is using phylink or not.

The real question is how do we want to describe an ethernet controller
and what properties should we be requiring for it (if any). Maybe if we
want to require one of a PHY, PCS, SFP, or fixed-link, maybe we should
have that as a strictly-checked ethernet controller which drivers can
opt into using if that's what they require.

However, to dress this up as "phylink requires xyz, so lets create
a phylink binding description" is just wrong.
