Hi Eugeniu,

Thanks for your report!

Table 17.5 ("Selecting On-Chip Peripheral Module Request Modes") of
"R-Car Series, 3rd Generation Userâ€™s Manual: Hardware" gained entries
for SCIF2 in Revision 1.50 of the document, but it seems 17.1.1
("Features") and Table 17.6 ("Data Length of DMA Transfer for Each of
the On-Chip Peripheral Modules") were forgotten to be updated.
The addition of the entry for SCIF2 is also mentioned in "Renesas
Technical Update  TN-RCT-S019A/E / R-Car M3-W Additional Explanation for
Direct Memory Access Controller for System (SYS-DMAC)".
Unfortunately both documents report wrong MID/RID values, due to a
hexadecimal vs. decimal mistake, which were corrected in the Feb 12
errata for Rev. 1.50.

So in my understanding, and according to my testing, DMA has always
worked for SCIF2 on (at least) R-Car H3 ES1.0/2.0, M3-W, and M3-N.
However, early firmware versions (before IPL and Secure Monitor
Rev1.0.6, released on Feb 25, 2016) prohibited the use of SYS-DMAC2,
cfr. commit eb21089c32054ecd ("arm64: dts: renesas: r8a7795: Add missing
SYS-DMAC2 dmas").

Perhaps some firmware versions may impose additional restrictions?

I have checked my kernel logs, and found a few instances of "Channel
Address Error".  In all cases, I had enabled/added extra debug prints in
the sh-sci driver, which may have had impact.
Last occurrence was in a kernel based on v4.18-rc2, which predates
several recent fixes for the sh-sci and rcar-dmac drivers.
Can the issue be reproduced on current mainline?

Thanks!
