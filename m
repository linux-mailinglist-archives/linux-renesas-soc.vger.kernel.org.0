So the DTB should describe both ;-)

IMHO the old masking technique is the hacky solution covered by
plasters.

DT describes the hardware.  In general, where to put the kernel is a
software policy, and thus doesn't belong in DT, except perhaps under
/chosen.  But that would open another can of worms, as people usually
have no business in specifying where the kernel should be located.
In the crashkernel case, there is a clear separation between memory to
be used by the crashkernel, and memory to be solely inspected by the
crashkernel.

Devicetree Specification, Release v0.3, Section 3.4 "/memory node" says:

    "The client program may access memory not covered by any memory
     reservations (see section 5.3)"

(Section 5.3 "Memory Reservation Block" only talks about structures in
the FDT, not about DTS)

Hence according to the above, the crashkernel is rightfully allowed to
do whatever it wants with all memory under the /memory node.
However, there is also
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/reserved-memory/reserved-memory.txt.
This suggests the crashkernel should be passed a DTB that contains a
/reserved-memory node, describing which memory cannot be used freely.
Then the decompressor needs to take this into account when deciding
where the put the kernel.

Yes, the above requires changing code. But at least it provides a
path forward, getting rid of the fragile old masking technique.

Thanks for your comments!
