Thank you!

ou mean "Make sync_state()/handoff work for the common clk
framework"[1]? IIUIC, that presentation didn't cover the problem we are
facing, except for the big "Kconfig for clk_ignore_unused=true" hammer.

That's an interesting comment, as the issue is that currently Linux
does touch (resources belonging to) reserved nodes, and this patch
would prevent doing that for module clock resources;-)

The core issue is that Linux distinguishes only between two cases:
  1. "device is used by Linux" (if a driver is available),
     as indicated by 'status = "okay"' in DT, or
  2. "device is unused by Linux".
On a heterogenous system, the latter actually comprises two cases:
  2a. "device is unused", or
  2b. "device is used by another OS running on another CPU core".

Looking for 'status = "reserved"' allows us to distinguish between 2a
and 2b, and can prevent disabling clocks that are used by another OS.
Probably we need a similar solution for power domains.

Do you have a better or alternative suggestion?
Thanks!
