Understood. Then I will refrain from enforcing link descriptions altogether
as I can't justify enforcing them on ethernet controllers selectively
because certain Linux drivers don't make use of the link properties and may
expose bugs if used.

The link properties are still allowed for all ethernet controllers though,
just not enforced. But I suppose it's better to optionally find the bug
instead of causing a regression then finding the bug.
