That's a great idea, I never thought about turning it into a module!

Hmmm does it mean it will run on the CPU that writes this "run" ?
Because this could allow one to start tests using e.g.:

    taskset -c $CPU tee /sys/.../run <<< y

But we could also wonder if it wouldn't be easier to either send "y"
to /sys/.../cpu0/run or may just send the CPU number to "run" instead
of "y". In my experience with this tool, you most always want to easily
control the CPU number because SoCs these days are not symmetrical at
all.

Nice!

That's strange. I only ever managed to get off results at -O0, but at
-O1/-Og/-Os/-O2/-O3/-Ofast I've always got consistent results on all
the machines I've tested. Especially seeing results higher than the
real value is troubling. One possibility would be that one some archs
there's not enough registers and the compiler needs to use a variable
in the stack, but that could only explain the lower perf, not the higher
one. But indeed, it could be interesting to have a look at the code to
understand why it's doing that. If we figure that there's an inherent
limitation on some rare archs, in the worst case we could place a
warning there.

I've responded there and we definitely need to address this, thanks!

Another point is that it would be nice if there was a way to present
the result in a form that a script can retrieve from the directory,
maybe the last measurement or something like this. I know that scripts
are commonly used to check for a machine's correct behavior, and I try
to encourage users to verify that it's working well, so anything we can
do that makes it easier to use would be welcome.

But overall, I like it! You've got my ack.

Hmmm I don't know if this is intended, the SPDX tag says MIT but the
MODULE_LICENSE at the top says MIT/GPL. I can't say I care that much but
I preferred to report it in case it's an accident ;-)

Thanks!
Willy
