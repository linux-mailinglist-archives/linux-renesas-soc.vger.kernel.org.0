It looks like the root cause here was the lack of dt-bindings to only allow
the phy-mode values the hardware supports. What I see here is the driver
change should've been tested on all different hardware the driver controls
then the improper describing of hardware on the devicetree source file
addressed.

If a devicetree change that ensures proper describing of hardware is found
to break a driver in the future, then that exposes a bug on the driver and
the driver will have to be fixed. I don't see this upholding writing
dt-bindings that ensures proper describing of the hardware.

Looks like we can incorporate dsa.port and dsa-port.yaml into
ethernet-switch.yaml and ethernet-switch-port.yaml with adjustments.
