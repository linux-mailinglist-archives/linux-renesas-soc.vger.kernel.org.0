I don't think so - nonetheless it's time we agreed on something and be
done with it. Bjorn expressed his opinion on this and unless we have a
compelling reason not to follow it IMO it'd be better to take it.

I don't think using rcar-pcie is a disaster either.

Let me know how you want to proceed, thanks.
