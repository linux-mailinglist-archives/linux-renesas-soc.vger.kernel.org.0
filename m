Ah yes, bisecting indeed would be useful here.

So perhaps this line should be re-added, or the fields updated for
wildcards some how, or a better form of matching the target.

Things like the H3 could be tricky though where the ES1 and ES2
revisions (I think from what I recall) might have subtle differences.

I guess in that case it's harder to make a catch-all match, but that's
just a per-target thing to consider.
